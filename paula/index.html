<div class=intro>
Paula Script is a lightweight scripting language written in C++.
<p>
<b class=subtitle>Small and stand-alone</b><br>Minimal external dependencies and built-in parser. The whole thing only takes up a few dozen kilobytes.
<p>
<b class=subtitle>No runtime memory allocation</b><br>Reserve all the required memory at startup for performance, predictability, and safety.
<p>
<b class=subtitle>Easy to expand</b><br>Add callbacks from your source code with a simple API.
</div>

<p>
Paula script example: a script that prints 20 Fibonacci numbers (n=20).
<pre class=paula>
n:20; i:0; a:0; b:1
while(i &lt; n)
	c:a+b
	print(c, " ")
	a:b; b:c
	i:i+1
</pre>

C++ callback example: create a C++ callback and call it from script.

<pre>
const paula::Error* myCallback (paula::Args&args) {
  for (int i=0; i&lt;args.count(); i++) {
    char * value;
    if (args.get(i).getChars(value)) {
      std::cout&lt;&lt;"arg "&lt;&lt;i&lt;&lt;": "&lt;&lt;value&lt;&lt;std::endl;
    }
  }
  return NO_ERROR;
}

void main()
{
  // register a callback for Paula engine
  auto error = paula::addCallback("test", myCallback);
  // call it from a script
  error = paula::run("test(\"foo\", \"bar\")");
}
</pre>
If you run the code, it prints
<pre>
arg 0: foo
arg 1: bar
</pre>

<h3>What is a scripting language?</h3>

Computer programs or apps consist of
<ul>
<li><b>Machine code:</b> instructions that tell <b>CPU</b> what to do.
<li><b>Data:</b> pictures, text, <b>scripts</b>, etc. that the app uses.
</ul>

Scripts control computer programs by instructions, written in some <b>scripting language</b>, like Python or JavaScript... <b>or Paula!</b>
A common example of a scripting language in use is JavaScript, which is used by web pages to add functionality.


<div><img class=wide_pic src=pics/app.png></div>

<p>
CPU (Central Processing Unit) is a microprocessor and the "brain" of the computer, smart phone, or other electronic gadget.
It reads and executes the machine code to make the app run.
<p>
Machine code is executed by the CPU whereas scripts are <b>interpreted</b> and executed by the program.

<p>
Inside the machine code is the script interpreter that does what the script it tells it to do.
So, the CPU executes the script interpreter (Paula), and the interpreter executes the script, if that makes any sense.

<!--
<p>
A scripting language defines a strict format that the instructions are given, so that the program code can interpret it.
-->

<h3>Economic scripting</h3>

Paula (meaning "small" in Latin) is a compact language designed to take up minimal space in a program. This is especially important in constrained environments, such as electronic devices, where the interpreter, other code, and scripts must all fit within a limited memory (RAM).

<div><img class=wide_pic src=pics/microcontroller.png></div>

If the interpreter is too big, you just can't use it.

<div><img width=30% class=small_pic src=pics/python.png></div>

In addition to being compact, Paula is designed to be suitable for environments without such resource limitations,
providing the needed flexibility while remaining secure and efficient, <b>something between archaic and extravagant</b>.
<p>

<!--The objective of the Paula scripting language is to be both easier to use and more expressive compared to old, clumsy languages such as Tiny BASIC and Forth.
On the other hand, it aims to be more expandable and economical than modern scripting languages like Lua and Python.
Its goal is to be something between archaic and clumsy and fancy but extravagant scripting languages.-->

<!--
<h3>Paula doesn't reserve memory when running</h3>

<h3>Memory allotion</h3>


Most script interpreters allocate memory for their use during runtime. Allocated memory is freed when it's not needed anymore.

<p>
Usually, this approach is fine and practical. Problems arise, however, if more memory is allocated than is available, causing the program to slow down or crash. This can happen, for example, when large files are loaded into memory for processing.


<div><img width= 50% class=small_pic src=pics/alloc.png></div>
In Paula, this issue does not occur because it doesn't allocate memory during runtime at all. Paula's users can be confident that it won't cause unpleasant surprises due to excessive memory allocation.

<p>
The downside is that the user must know how much memory Paula will need and define it when launching the program. However, the guarantee that users can specify the required memory themselves provides a sense of security and reliability to Paula's users.
