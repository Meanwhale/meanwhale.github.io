    "news_text": "Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, Venezuelan opposition candidate, claimed he was coerced into recognizing Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as the winner of the disputed July elections before being granted asylum in Spain. In a video message, he stated that Maduro's aides pressured him to sign a letter while he was at the Spanish embassy in Caracas. However, Maduro's ally, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, contended that Gonz\u00e1lez signed willingly. Gonz\u00e1lez described the signed letter as 'worthless' and emphasized his role as the 'president-elected' of many Venezuelans seeking change. Following his claims, Rodr\u00edguez threatened to release audio evidence contradicting Gonz\u00e1lez's statements. The Venezuelan electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner, but the opposition claims evidence of Gonz\u00e1lez's victory.",
