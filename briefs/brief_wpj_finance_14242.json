    "news_text": "Toronto's housing market is struggling with affordability, influenced by zoning laws and policies like inclusionary zoning, which mandates affordable units in new developments. Despite efforts to increase affordable housing, reliance on private developers and neoliberal principles has limited effectiveness.

Public opinion supports more multi-family homes, yet experts argue that zoning changes alone are insufficient to resolve the housing crisis.",
