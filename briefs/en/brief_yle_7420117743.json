    "news_text": "Kazan, a multicultural city in Russia, is preparing to host the Brics summit, marking the largest international conference in the country since the onset of military operations in Ukraine. The city has undergone significant renovations, with streets and buildings updated to enhance its image. Residents, including Vasil Valiyev, express a mix of excitement and concern over the influx of delegations from 34 countries. The Brics group, originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has expanded to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE. The summit aims to strengthen economic ties and potentially establish a new payment system, as Russia seeks to reduce reliance on the dollar. Local entrepreneurs and residents acknowledge the city's transformation over the past decade, highlighting a safer and more vibrant Kazan, while also noting the challenges posed by the summit preparations.",
