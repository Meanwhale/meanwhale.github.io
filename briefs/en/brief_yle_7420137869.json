    "news_text": "The US Immigration and Customs Office (ICE) had intended to initiate mass deportation operations in the Chicago area immediately following Donald Trump's inauguration. Tom Homan, appointed head of border policy, indicated that the new administration is re-evaluating these deportation plans. Although large-scale raids were expected to begin on January 21, the final decision has not yet been made. Homan expressed concerns about the security risks of leaking plans to the press, and the Wall Street Journal reported that the raids could involve 100-200 police officers and last about a week, aiming to set an example for cities with limited cooperation with federal immigration authorities.",
