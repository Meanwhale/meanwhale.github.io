    "news_header": "France faces significant economic challenges as public debt surges and the government prepares budget cuts and tax increases.",
    "news_text": "France's public debt has ballooned in recent years, prompting the government to present a budget proposal that includes cuts to public services and social security, as well as tax hikes for the wealthy and large corporations. The country's budgetary issues have been exacerbated by excessive deficits, leading to scrutiny from the EU. The current deficit stands at 5.5%, with projections of reaching 6.1%. The government aims to reduce the deficit to 5% next year and 3% by 2029, with planned savings of \u20ac40 billion and additional revenue from tax increases. However, public acceptance of these austerity measures is uncertain, given past protests against similar policies. The new Prime Minister, Michel Barnier, is navigating a complex political landscape, needing to balance the demands of both the far-right and left-wing factions in parliament.",
