    "news_text": "A study published in Communications Physics reports that asteroid Bennu shows no signs of being influenced by a proposed 'fifth force' that could affect its orbit. This finding helps set limits on the strength of such a force, which some scientists believe could explain dark matter, an unknown source of mass in the universe. Bennu was chosen for this research due to its accurately tracked trajectory by NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, which returned samples to Earth in 2023. The data from Bennu may provide insights into both known and unknown forces in physics, as well as the nature of dark matter.",
