    "news_text": "The Los Angeles County Prosecutor, George Gasc\u00f3n, has announced his intention to appeal the convictions of Erik and Lyle Menendez, who are serving life sentences for the murder of their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez, over 30 years ago. This renewed attention follows a recent Netflix documentary. Gasc\u00f3n stated that the brothers endured significant abuse at home, suggesting they have paid their debts despite the heinous nature of their crime. The prosecution originally argued that the brothers planned the murder to inherit their family's wealth, while the defense claims it was a response to years of mental, physical, and sexual abuse. New evidence, including a letter from Erik detailing abuse and testimonies from a former Menudo band member about being drugged and raped by Jose Menendez, has emerged. The case is set to be reviewed by a panel, with a final decision on the brothers' release to be made by a judge.",
