    "news_text": "Researchers from the University of Toronto found that sled dogs in Ontario, Canada, experience a noticeable disruption in their routines due to the seasonal time change, becoming active an hour earlier after clocks fall back. In contrast, pet dogs of the same breeds did not show any significant change in behavior. The study, part of a broader investigation into canine behavior, highlights that working dogs are closely aligned with their strict schedules, while pets adapt more easily. The findings suggest that gradual adjustments to routine changes may benefit working dogs, as abrupt shifts can be unsettling.",
