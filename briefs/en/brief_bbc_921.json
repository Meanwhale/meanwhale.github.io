    "news_text": "Shares in Seven & i Holdings, the owner of 7-Eleven, rose significantly following a new takeover bid from Canadian company Alimentation Couche-Tard, which is reportedly valued at over $47 billion, approximately 20% higher than a previous offer. Seven & i had rejected a $38 billion offer in September, citing undervaluation and regulatory challenges. The new offer was submitted on September 19, but no discussions have occurred since. Seven & i is considered a core business for Japan's national security, which complicates foreign investment. If the acquisition proceeds, Couche-Tard would significantly expand its presence in North America and globally.",
