    "news_text": "Hino Motors, a subsidiary of Toyota, has agreed to pay $1.6 billion and plead guilty to misleading US regulators regarding the emissions from its diesel engines. The company will also be banned from exporting diesel engines to the US for five years. This follows charges of fraud for selling 105,000 illegal engines in the US from 2010 to 2022. The settlement requires US court approval. Hino submitted false emission testing data in a criminal conspiracy, violating laws meant to protect public health and the environment. Hino has committed to a compliance plan and will recall certain heavy-duty trucks to address excess emissions. The company reported a significant financial loss due to these legal issues.",
