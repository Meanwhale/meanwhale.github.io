    "news_text": "DeepSeek, a Chinese-made AI model, has topped Apple Store downloads, surprising investors and affecting tech stocks. Released on January 20, it impressed AI experts and drew attention from the tech industry. US President Trump called it a 'wake-up call' for US companies. DeepSeek claims to be built at a lower cost than leading models like OpenAI's by using fewer advanced chips, leading to a significant drop in Nvidia's market value. The model raises questions about US efforts to contain China's tech ambitions, as China prioritizes AI development. DeepSeek, like other Chinese AI models, avoids politically sensitive topics due to government censorship. Founded by Liang Wenfeng, DeepSeek's success challenges the belief that only high budgets and advanced chips can drive AI innovation, leading to uncertainty in the tech market.",
