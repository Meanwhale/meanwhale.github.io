    "news_original_title": "Electronic devices used for car thefts set to be banned",
    "news_text": "New legislation in England and Wales seeks to ban sophisticated electronic devices, such as signal jammers, commonly used in car thefts. Last year, over 700,000 vehicles were broken into, with high-tech devices implicated in 40% of thefts. The new Crime and Policing Bill will require individuals possessing such devices to prove they are for legitimate purposes, shifting the burden of proof from law enforcement. Offenders could face up to five years in prison or unlimited fines for manufacturing or selling these devices. Keyless repeaters and signal amplifiers are particularly problematic, allowing criminals to unlock cars remotely. The police and motoring groups emphasize the need for enhanced vehicle security measures from manufacturers. The NPCC supports the initiative, highlighting that these devices have long been an accessible tool for criminals. The Crime and Policing Bill will be introduced to Parliament soon.",
