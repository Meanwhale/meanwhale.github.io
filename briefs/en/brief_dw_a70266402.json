    "news_text": "During the European summer, COVID-19 infections increased, with test positivity for SARS-CoV-2 exceeding 20%. The US also experienced a rise in hospitalizations linked to infections from Singapore. As autumn approaches, two new variants, KP.3 and XEC, are under scrutiny. KP.3 is classified as a Variant of Concern in the US due to its predominance and higher infectiousness. XEC is a recombinant variant believed to have formed from KP.3 and another variant, KS.1.1. Despite being detected in Germany, XEC has not been officially tracked. KP.3.1.1, a sub-variant of KP.3, is currently the most dominant variant, raising concerns particularly for vulnerable populations. The CDC recommends an updated COVID-19 vaccine for the upcoming season.",
