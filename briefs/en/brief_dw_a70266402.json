    "news_text": "During the European summer, COVID-19 infections increased, with test positivity rates exceeding 20% in Europe and around 10% globally. The US experienced a rise in hospitalizations following an infection wave in Singapore. As autumn and winter approach, two new variants, KP.3 and its sub-variant KP.3.1.1, along with the recombinant variant XEC, have emerged as concerns. KP.3 is classified as a Variant of Concern in the US due to its predominance and increased infectiousness. The CDC recommends an updated COVID-19 vaccine for 2024-2025. Omicron remains the dominant variant globally, with KP variants being descendants of it. XEC has been detected in Germany but is not widely reported. The focus in Germany is on KP.3.1.1, which is more infectious than previous variants. The risks associated with KP.3.1.1 are particularly significant for older adults and young children.",
