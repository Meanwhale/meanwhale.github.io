    "news_text": "During the European summer, COVID-19 infections increased, with test positivity rates exceeding 20% in Europe and around 10% globally. The US experienced a rise in hospitalizations following infections in Singapore. As autumn approaches, two new variants, KP.3 and XEC, are causing concern. KP.3 is classified as a Variant of Concern (VOC) in the US, while XEC is a recombinant variant related to KP.3. The CDC recommends an updated COVID-19 vaccine. KP.3 is more infectious than previous variants and has become predominant. XEC was first detected in Germany but has not been officially tracked. The focus remains on KP.3.1.1, which is also more infectious. FLiRT variants, including KP.3, show potential for increased danger and vaccine evasion. The CDC notes heightened risks for individuals over 65 and children under 2.",
