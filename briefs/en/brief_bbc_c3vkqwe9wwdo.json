    "news_text": "South Korea's intelligence agency has claimed that North Korea has begun sending troops to assist Russia in the Ukraine conflict, with estimates suggesting up to 12,000 soldiers may eventually be involved. This follows Ukrainian President Zelensky's assertion that 10,000 North Koreans could join the fight. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol convened a security meeting, emphasizing the need for a coordinated international response. Reports indicate that North Korean troops are training at Russian military bases, and North Korea has been supplying Russia with significant amounts of ammunition. While some experts believe North Korean troops may not be immediately effective on the front lines due to language barriers and lack of recent combat experience, they could potentially serve in support roles along the Russian-Ukrainian border.",
