    "news_text": "The Swedish Defence Forces are investigating the disappearance of up to 70 military vehicles and 50 electric generators from a warehouse in K\u00f6pingebro, Sk\u00e5ne county. They attribute the loss to the Swedish Association for Voluntary National Defence Training, which has received military equipment since the 1990s. Jan Bohman, head of communications for the Southern Military Region, expressed outrage over the incident, stating that they have been searching for the missing items for a year. The Ystad association disputes the Defence Forces' claims, suggesting that the number of missing vehicles is exaggerated and that some generators were scrapped due to obsolescence. The association's board member, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00e5rdstedt, indicated that the area has been inadequately secured, leading to potential thefts and losses.",
