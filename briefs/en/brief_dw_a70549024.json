    "news_text": "King Charles III and Queen Camilla visited Canberra, Australia, marking their first trip to the city in almost ten years and the King's first major foreign tour since his cancer diagnosis. During a reception hosted by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, an Indigenous senator, Lidia Thorpe, interrupted Charles' speech with anti-colonial slogans, demanding the return of Indigenous lands and a treaty. The visit reignited discussions about Australia potentially becoming a republic, with Albanese suggesting it may be time for the monarchy's role to end. The Australian Republic Movement has also reached out to the King, but Buckingham Palace stated that the decision lies with the Australian public.",
