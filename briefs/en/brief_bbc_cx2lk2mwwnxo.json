    "news_text": "Elon Musk's Starship, the largest and most powerful spacecraft ever built, is designed to be fully reusable, akin to an airplane. SpaceX's fifth test flight on October 13 marked a significant success, with the Super Heavy booster returning to the launch pad. Starship is a two-stage vehicle capable of carrying over 150 tonnes to low-Earth orbit, powered by 33 engines. Although it has not yet carried crew, Musk envisions it facilitating human trips to Mars in the future. The rocket's environmental impact is notable, with potential emissions from frequent launches raising concerns. Starship's versatility could also support satellite launches, space telescopes, and lunar infrastructure development.",
