    "news_text": "According to the latest survey of the Cult Union, around one quarter of consumers have been stuck in years of economic distress. After years, some consumers see signs of improvement in their own economy, but the survey shows that the situation of those in difficulties is not improving. According to the survey, one in four consumers is estimated to have no funds for expenditure growth. Rising food prices have been the main burden on consumers&#x27; economy, with more than half of over a thousand respondents estimating that rising food prices have had a fairly significant or even more pronounced impact on their own economy.",
