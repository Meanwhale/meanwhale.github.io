    "news_original_title": "UK to dispose of radioactive plutonium stockpile",
    "news_text": "The UK government has announced its decision to dispose of 140 tonnes of radioactive plutonium currently stored at Sellafield, Cumbria. This material, a byproduct of nuclear fuel reprocessing, has been accumulating for decades. Instead of recycling it into new nuclear fuel, the government aims to immobilize the plutonium by converting it into a stable, rock-like material for permanent disposal underground. This decision, which is expected to reduce long-term safety and security burdens, is supported by experts who believe it will eliminate the costs and hazards associated with current storage methods. A new facility will be built at Sellafield for this purpose, with the entire process expected to take until at least 2050.",
