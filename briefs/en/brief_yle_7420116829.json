    "news_text": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n stated that the current situation in Europe is the most serious in its history, citing the war in Ukraine, escalating Middle Eastern crises, and a migrant crisis that threatens the Schengen system. He emphasized the need for change in the EU and expressed Hungary's desire to be a catalyst for this transformation during his speech in the European Parliament. Orb\u00e1n criticized the EU's green transition for undermining competitiveness and highlighted the lag in digital technology. He proposed reducing regulations and strengthening the single market. He also suggested that migrants should be processed outside the EU and called for regular meetings to address internal free movement. Additionally, he advocated for the acceleration of Western Balkan integration and the full inclusion of Bulgaria and Romania in the Schengen area by year-end. His speech concluded with a call to 'make Europe great again.' Following his address, there were anti-fascist protests, which the European Parliament President had to manage. Orb\u00e1n's leadership has raised concerns about EU unity, as he has engaged in negotiations with Ukraine, Russia, and China without the approval of other EU nations, leading to tensions with EU officials.",
