    "news_header": "European demand for LNG is expected to rise sharply in 2025 due to reduced Russian gas imports and increased competition for supplies.",
    "news_text": "Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Europe is projected to increase significantly in 2025, following a 13% rise in imports this year. This surge is attributed to the EU's decreasing reliance on Russian gas, which has led to heightened competition in the global market. Analysts believe that while prices may rise, Europe will secure sufficient LNG supplies. Concerns about low gas storage levels have emerged, especially in the UK. The EU remains the largest buyer of Russian LNG, despite calls for a reduction in imports. Future supply is expected to increase, particularly from the US and Qatar, but political will is essential for the EU to reduce its dependency on Russian energy.",
