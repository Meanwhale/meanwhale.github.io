    "news_text": "Finnair experienced a 9% increase in passenger numbers, reaching 3.2 million from July to September. However, the company's comparable operating result fell to EUR 71.5 million from EUR 94.3 million in the same period last year, despite a slight increase in net sales to EUR 818.3 million. CEO Turkka Kuusisto noted that the previous year's strong performance made comparisons challenging as unit revenue declined with normalized demand. Finnair expanded its flight offerings to 85 destinations, including new routes to London and Phuket. The airline anticipates continued growth in international air traffic but faces risks from inflation, rising interest rates, and economic and political instability affecting fuel prices.",
