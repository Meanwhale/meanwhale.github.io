    "news_text": "Finnair has announced change negotiations during an ongoing pilot work dispute, threatening redundancies for around 90 long-distance pilots. The airline is also preparing to terminate its cooperation with Qantas, having rented two Airbus A330 aircraft to them for two years due to a lack of operational use stemming from a Russian overflight ban. The first aircraft began flying Qantas flights in October 2023, with the second set to start in early 2024. The ongoing negotiations for a new collective agreement have been stalled since August, with significant differences between the pilots and the employer regarding reserve pilots, which are crucial for reliable airline operations.",
