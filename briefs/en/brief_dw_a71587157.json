    "news_header": "Klaus Iohannis resigned as Romania&#x27;s president after two terms, marking the end of a presidency that began with hopes for reform but ended in unpopularity. His resignation, prompted by impeachment proceedings, has raised concerns about the rise of far-right forces in Romania. Observers are divided on the implications of his departure, with some fearing a victory for the far right, while others see it as a strategic retreat. Iohannis&#x27; presidency was marked by public silence and missteps, leading to a perception of detachment from the populace. His legacy includes a strengthened far-right presence in parliament and a tarnished reputation for failing to meet reform expectations.",
