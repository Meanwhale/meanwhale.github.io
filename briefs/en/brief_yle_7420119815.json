    "news_text": "Since 2019, Kotipizza Group has used Finnish meat for its pizzas, but has now introduced a new diavola pizza in Africa that features foreign meat for the first time in five years. CEO Heidi Stirkkonen explained that the decision was influenced by financial responsibilities and inflation pressures, allowing for competitive pricing. The diavola pizza contains nduja sausage sourced from Danish Crown, with potential plans to include more foreign meat products in the future. Finnish meat producers are encouraged to participate in international competitions to supply their products to Kotipizza's over 800 restaurants, provided they meet quality and responsibility standards.",
