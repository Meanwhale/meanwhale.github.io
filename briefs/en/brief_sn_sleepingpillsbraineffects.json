    "news_text": "A recent study highlights the potential downsides of using sleep aids such as Ambien, which may interfere with the brain&#x27;s natural waste-clearing processes during sleep. While these medications can help individuals fall asleep faster, they may compromise important functions like the removal of harmful proteins associated with diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s. Researchers emphasize the need for new sleep aids that promote sleep without disrupting these critical brain functions, as the long-term effects of current medications remain uncertain.",
