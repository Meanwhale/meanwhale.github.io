    "news_text": "Delfino Davies, a resident of Gardi Sugdub, Panama, shares his sorrow over the relocation of his community due to climate change. The island is at risk of becoming uninhabitable by 2050, prompting most residents to move to a new settlement on the mainland. While some see this relocation as a model for others facing similar threats, it has divided the community. Many residents miss their homes and the cultural essence tied to the island, despite improved living conditions in the new settlement. The Guna people, who have lived on Gardi Sugdub for generations, face a loss of tradition and identity as they adapt to their new environment.",
