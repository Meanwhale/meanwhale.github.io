    "news_text": "Finland has been grappling with state debt for 15 years, which has become a significant issue in elections and government policy. Minister Petteri Orpo emphasizes the need to curb this debt, but critics argue that the Finance Ministry's increasing power is problematic. Recent changes in how debt is calculated have inflated Finland's debt ratio, raising concerns about EU financial oversight. The text highlights that much of the debt issue stems from government decisions and mismanagement, including the handling of loans and military expenditures. The author, Heikki Cari.ean, suggests that the growing debt empowers the Finance Ministry to dictate political agendas, often without adequate scrutiny.",
