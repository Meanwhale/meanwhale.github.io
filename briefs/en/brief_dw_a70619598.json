    "news_text": "Ryan and Righ, a same-sex couple from Taiwan and China, celebrated their legal partnership at the Taiwan Pride Parade, which attracted over 180,000 attendees. Their relationship, which began in 2016, faced challenges due to legal restrictions on cross-strait couples. After years of appeals, a court ruling allowed them to reunite in Taiwan, leading to the lifting of restrictions on marriage registrations for cross-strait couples. While they are hopeful about their future together, activists highlight ongoing political tensions and financial barriers that could affect other couples. The Taiwanese government's recent changes are seen as a significant advancement for the LGBTQ+ movement, providing more options for cross-strait couples.",
