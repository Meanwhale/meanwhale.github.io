    "news_text": "On Saturday, thousands of mostly female demonstrators gathered in Washington DC for the People's March, previously known as the Women's March, to protest against President-elect Donald Trump just two days before his inauguration. The event, organized by a coalition of groups aiming to confront 'Trumpism', saw about 5,000 attendees, significantly lower than the expected 50,000. Protesters expressed various motivations, including support for abortion rights and frustration with the election outcome. The march coincided with Trump's arrival in the capital for inaugural events, and while smaller than previous years, it continued to symbolize resistance against his agenda.",
