    "news_header": "Israel has conducted extensive airstrikes in Lebanon, resulting in significant civilian casualties and displacement, while France seeks to mediate a ceasefire amid the ongoing conflict involving Hezbollah and Hamas.",
    "news_text": "For the past month, Israel has been launching major airstrikes on Lebanon, killing over 2,000 civilians and displacing more than 1 million people, according to Lebanese authorities. The Israeli military aims to weaken Hezbollah, which has retaliated with missile attacks on northern Israel in support of Hamas. France is attempting to leverage its historical ties with Lebanon to facilitate a ceasefire and provide humanitarian aid, organizing an international conference in Paris. However, experts express skepticism about the conference's potential success due to the current geopolitical climate, with both Hezbollah and Israel showing little interest in a ceasefire. The situation is further complicated by France's strained relations with Israel and the instability in Lebanon, which has not had a president since October 2022. Observers believe that the conference may yield only symbolic results rather than substantial political change.",
