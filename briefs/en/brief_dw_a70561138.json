    "news_text": "On Monday, police in Mozambique fired tear gas at opposition leader Venancio Mondlane and his supporters in Maputo. Mondlane, who is the main challenger to the ruling Frelimo party, was addressing journalists near the site of a recent violent incident involving the deaths of his lawyer and a senior party official. The protests were sparked by tensions following the October 9 elections, which preliminary results suggest Frelimo will win, extending its long-standing rule. Activists have denounced the elections as fraudulent, leading Mondlane to call for a national strike. Clashes erupted as police attempted to disperse peaceful protesters, resulting in injuries among journalists and demonstrators. International bodies, including the African Union and the European Union, condemned the violence and called for investigations into the killings of opposition figures.",
