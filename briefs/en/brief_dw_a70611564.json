    "news_text": "The ruling Georgian Dream party secured over 54% of the votes in Georgia's parliamentary election, which is viewed as a setback for pro-European integration efforts. Opposition parties have rejected the results, alleging electoral fraud and calling for protests. President Salome Zourabichvili and former President Mikheil Saakashvili have both denounced the election outcome, with claims of manipulation and irregularities. International observers noted significant issues, including voter intimidation and media polarization. While Georgian Dream claims to support EU membership, its ties to Russia raise concerns about the country's political direction. Calls for investigations into the election's conduct have been made by various international officials.",
