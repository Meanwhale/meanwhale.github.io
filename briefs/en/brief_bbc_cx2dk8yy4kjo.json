    "news_text": "Mining companies BHP and Vale have reached a $30bn compensation deal with the Brazilian government for the 2015 Mariana dam disaster, which resulted in 19 deaths and extensive environmental damage. Brazilian President Lula attended the signing, emphasizing the need for companies to learn from the incident. The agreement includes payments to local authorities and compensation for affected communities. Despite previous compensation efforts, many victims feel justice has not been served. Additionally, over 620,000 people are pursuing legal action against BHP in the UK for further damages, while 70,000 are suing Vale in the Netherlands. Both companies deny liability and claim the overseas lawsuits are unnecessary.",
