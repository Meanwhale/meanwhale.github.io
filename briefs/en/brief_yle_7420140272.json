    "news_text": "Nordea's operating profit grew by four percent in the fourth quarter compared to the previous year, reaching close to EUR 1.5 billion. However, the difference between interest received and paid decreased by five percent to just under EUR 1.9 billion due to ongoing reductions in key interest rates. Net commission income increased by eight percent, and overall operating income rose by one percent. Nordea Group President Frank Vang-Jensen attributed these results to a strong business performance and active customer engagement in saving and investing.",
