    "news_text": "A scientific study has confirmed that climate change was a major factor behind the hot, dry weather that led to the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles. According to World Weather Attribution, these conditions are now about 35% more likely due to climate change. The study highlights that the wildfire season is lengthening, and drought conditions are becoming more frequent, increasing the risk of fires during strong Santa Ana winds. The researchers found that the hot, dry conditions that drive these fires are expected to occur once every 17 years, a significant increase compared to a pre-warming world. While the study shows a clear link between climate change and the likelihood of wildfires, it is more cautious about the connections to the length of the fire season and rainfall.",
