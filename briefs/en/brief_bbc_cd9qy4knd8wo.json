    "news_text": "A scientific study has confirmed that climate change significantly contributed to the hot, dry conditions that led to the destructive wildfires in Los Angeles, making such weather events 35% more likely. The study highlights the increasing length of the wildfire season and the reduction of rainfall, which exacerbates fire risks. Researchers from World Weather Attribution used climate models to analyze the influence of global warming on extreme weather events, concluding that the conditions for the LA fires are expected to occur once every 17 years due to climate change. The study emphasizes the complexity of wildfires but affirms that a warming climate is increasing their frequency and severity.",
