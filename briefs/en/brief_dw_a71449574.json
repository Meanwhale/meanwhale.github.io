    "news_original_title": "DR Congo: 'Diplomacy has failed'",
    "news_text": "The M23 rebels, supported by Rwanda, have expanded their control over Goma, the provincial capital of eastern DR Congo, causing chaos in a city of nearly 2 million. The UN expressed deep concern, highlighting the urgent need for humanitarian aid. Experts believe that the ongoing ethnic tensions cannot be resolved through negotiations in the short term. The political conflict involves Congolese President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame, with both sides holding firm to their positions. Previous peace initiatives have failed, and the international community is now looking towards Angola for mediation. The Luanda Roadmap aims to address the conflict and promote economic development in the region, but the prospects for lasting peace remain bleak.",
