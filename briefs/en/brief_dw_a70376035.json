    "news_header": "Portugal has ended the practice of allowing illegally arrived migrant workers to stay while applying for work permits, citing alignment with European regulations. This move has drawn criticism from NGOs, who see it as a concession to right-wing populists and a reflection of disorganized immigration policy.",
    "news_text": "Portugal has abruptly ceased allowing illegally arrived migrant workers to remain in the country while applying for work permits, a decision attributed to alignment with European regulations by Deputy Minister Rui Armindo Freitas. Critics, including NGOs, argue that this change caters to right-wing populists and underscores the chaotic state of Portugal's immigration policy. The new requirement mandates that migrants apply for residence permits at Portuguese embassies abroad, which poses challenges for workers from countries lacking such embassies. The agricultural sector, heavily reliant on migrant labor, faces potential disruptions due to these changes, as many workers come without documentation and have previously been allowed to work while awaiting permits. The government aims to streamline the processing of a backlog of 400,000 applications and prevent human trafficking, but concerns remain that the new regulations may lead to an increase in undocumented migrants.",
