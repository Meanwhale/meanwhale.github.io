    "news_text": "The 2024 Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson for their studies on why some countries succeed while others fail. The announcement was made by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, concluding the 2024 Nobel season. The prize, valued at 11 million Swedish kronor (approximately $1 million), recognizes the laureates' significant contributions to understanding the relationship between political institutions and economic development. Acemoglu and Johnson are professors at MIT, while Robinson is affiliated with the University of Chicago. Their recent book, 'Why Nations Fail,' explores wealth inequality and the impact of technology on job creation and wealth distribution. The Nobel Prize in Economics was established in 1968 and has been awarded 55 times to 93 laureates. The prize has faced criticism for perceived ideological bias and its controversial status among Nobel awards. The laureates will receive their awards on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.",
