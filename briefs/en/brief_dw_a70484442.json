    "news_text": "The 2024 Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson for their influential studies on why some countries thrive while others do not. Announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, the award is valued at 11 million Swedish kronor (approximately $1 million). The laureates, known for their work on the impact of political institutions on economic development, highlighted the importance of societal institutions in reducing income disparities. Acemoglu expressed surprise at the recognition. The Nobel Prize in Economics, established in 1968, has been awarded 55 times to 93 laureates, with the U.S. having the most winners. The award has faced criticism for perceived ideological biases and its relevance to Alfred Nobel's original intentions. The winners will receive their awards on December 10.",
