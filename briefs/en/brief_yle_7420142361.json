    "news_text": "The USA has approximately 10,000 employees in the Development Agency, with the new administration aiming to reduce this number to only hundreds. Judge Carl Nichols has suspended President Trump&#x27;s plans to lay off around 2,200 employees, ordering that those already laid off be allowed to return to work. The decision is based on a union action and is valid until February 14. Trump has previously laid off about 500 employees and criticized the agency as an inefficient use of tax money, but has not provided evidence for his claims. Democrats argue that it would be unconstitutional for Trump to close state agencies unilaterally. The US allocates over $42 billion annually for development projects and food aid globally.",
