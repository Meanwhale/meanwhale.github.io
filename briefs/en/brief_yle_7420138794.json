    "news_text": "A recent economic survey indicates that the domestic economy is on a path to gradual improvement. The order backlog for non-financial corporations has slightly improved, with 36% of respondents reporting lower order books compared to a year ago, down from 40% in October. Growth expectations in manufacturing have also risen, with those anticipating growth increasing from 25% to 37%. Despite these positive trends, the overall sentiment among enterprises has worsened due to the prolonged economic downturn. The survey was conducted from January 8 to 10, involving around 1,600 companies across Finland.",
