    "news_text": "Nazim Alsaew, a Bolt driver in Helsinki, discusses the financial struggles faced by drivers who often work long hours, sometimes up to 50 hours a week, to earn a gross income of EUR 1,500-2,000 per month. Despite potential earnings of up to EUR 8,000 monthly, drivers have significant expenses, including a 23% brokerage fee taken by Bolt. Many drivers are in debt due to car expenses and are protesting for better pay and lower fees. Alsaew highlights that drivers are often unable to find alternative employment and expresses a desire for a more favorable working environment, considering boycotts if conditions do not improve.",
