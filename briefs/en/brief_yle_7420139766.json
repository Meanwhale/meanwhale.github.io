    "news_text": "In Denmark, a local fossil enthusiast discovered 66 million-year-old stoned vomit, dating back to the time of dinosaur extinction. The \u00d8stsj\u00e6llands Museum announced that scientists analyzed the vomit and found it contained at least two types of sea lilies, which are animals, not plants. This vomit likely came from fish that could not digest parts of their food. This discovery is significant for understanding historical ecosystems and the diets of prehistoric animals.",
