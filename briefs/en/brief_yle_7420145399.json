    "news_text": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n is focused on reducing inflation, even suggesting forceful measures if necessary. In his annual state address, he asserted that Ukraine would never join NATO, describing it as a buffer zone between Russia and NATO. Orb\u00e1n emphasized that decisions regarding Ukraine&#x27;s EU membership lie with Hungary, warning that such membership could devastate Hungarian agriculture and the economy. He outlined his electoral program, which includes tax exemptions for mothers of two or more children and a call for merchants to voluntarily limit food price increases. If this fails, he plans to propose cutting profits in the food trade. Additionally, Orb\u00e1n expressed support for &#x27;liberal networks&#x27; representing gender minorities.",
