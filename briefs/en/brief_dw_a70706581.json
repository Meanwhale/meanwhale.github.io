    "news_text": "As vote counting continues in the United States, social media is rife with false claims of voter fraud, including allegations of manipulated voting machines and ballots. Elon Musk has been a prominent figure in spreading misinformation, recently sharing a post that suggested Google was directing Kamala Harris supporters on where to vote, while neglecting Donald Trump supporters. This claim was misleading; Google clarified that the map shown for Harris was due to 'Harris' being a county name in Texas, whereas Trump is not associated with any county. Google has since rectified the search results to show news articles for both candidates. Musk acknowledged Google's clarification but left the original misleading post on his account.",
