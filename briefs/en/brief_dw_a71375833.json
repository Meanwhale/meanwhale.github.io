    "news_text": "OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle have formed a joint venture named Stargate, planning to invest up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure over the next four years. This announcement was praised by US President Donald Trump as a sign of confidence in America's potential. However, Elon Musk expressed skepticism about the project's viability. The investment will focus on building data centers, with an immediate $100 billion allocated. The decision follows Trump's revocation of a Biden-era executive order aimed at regulating AI risks. Discussions at the World Economic Forum in Davos highlight the implications of AI on jobs and the widening investment gap between the US and other countries, with experts warning that without proper regulations, inequalities may deepen. Countries are encouraged to invest in infrastructure and education to prepare for AI's impact.",
