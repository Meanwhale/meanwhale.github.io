    "news_text": "The duration of future frost days will impact when thermal winter is defined in Helsinki. A recent recalculation at the Kaisaniemi station indicates that thermal winter, traditionally marked by consistent sub-zero temperatures, is now calculated using the heat summation method. The current frost period, starting on February 2, could be the longest in over a century, potentially marking the third-latest start of thermal winter. If it lasts only 14 days, it would be the third shortest on record. Historical examples include winters in 2008 and 2020, which had notably late starts.",
