    "news_text": "The thermal winter in Helsinki is determined by the duration of frost days, with recent unusual weather prompting a recalculation. Traditionally, thermal winter starts when average daily temperatures consistently drop below zero. The current method uses heat summation to define this period. The calculation for this year's thermal winter began on December 31, with a 14-day freezing period. However, warm days followed, delaying the winter's start. Forecasts suggest the current frost period may extend beyond the initial 14 days, potentially marking February 2 as the start of thermal winter, which would be historically late. If the frost period does not extend, the winter may be defined by the earlier freezing period in January, which would be exceptionally short.",
