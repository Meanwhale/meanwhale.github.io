    "news_text": "Jamshid Sharmahd, a German-Iranian dissident, was executed in Iran after being convicted of leading terror operations and sentenced to death for 'corruption on Earth.' His family claimed he was merely a spokesman for a US-based pro-monarchist group. Germany's foreign minister condemned the execution, warning of serious consequences for Iran. Human rights organizations criticized the process as a violation of international law, alleging torture and forced confessions. Sharmahd's daughter expressed fears of a public execution as a message of terror against dissent. The execution was approved by Iran's Supreme Court, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz labeling it a 'scandal.'",
