    "news_text": "According to JLL's analysis, Asia Pacific hotel investments are projected to grow by 4.3% in 2024, totaling $12.2 billion, up from $11.7 billion in 2023. By September 2024, transaction volumes reached $9.05 billion, a 15% increase from the previous year. Japan is leading in cross-border investments, while Australia has seen a decline. JLL's CEO, Nihat Ercan, expressed confidence in exceeding last year's performance due to a positive economic outlook and strong consumption trends. Average daily rates have increased by 19% since the last peak in 2018-2019, although full recovery in occupancy may take longer due to slower returns from MICE events and economic challenges in Mainland China.",
