    "news_header": "The challenges faced by banks, particularly Nordea, stem from outdated systems and the reliance on aging technology, such as IBM's mainframe and Cobol programming language, leading to difficulties in modernizing and maintaining secure operations.",
    "news_text": "IBM's mainframe, which operates on the Cobol programming language developed in the late 1950s, remains a cornerstone of banking systems, but its reliance poses challenges as the technology ages and experts retire. Nordea's recent loss of customer accounts highlights the difficulties banks face in modernizing their systems, which are often expensive and complex. The transition from old to new systems can lead to errors, particularly in transferring account information. While Nordea has faced issues related to system reforms and cyber threats, ongoing efforts to update and secure their IT infrastructure are crucial. The Economic Committee of Parliament is set to discuss these banking issues further.",
