    "news_text": "The Jamuna river, considered sacred by Hindus for ritual washing, flows through Delhi and is severely polluted with toxic foam resulting from wastewater, agricultural pesticides, and industrial emissions from approximately 20 million residents. Despite efforts by the Indian government to build cleaning plants, the river's condition remains dire, with reports indicating that the water appears black except during rain. Vimlendu, from the Joe Protection Organisation, stated that the river's natural state is essentially dead, highlighting the environmental crisis affecting this important waterway, which ultimately feeds into the Ganges and the Indian Ocean.",
