    "news_original_title": "Why India fails to protect its domestic workers despite decades of abuse",
    "news_text": "Her story reflects the widespread mistreatment of domestic workers in India, particularly women from marginalized castes. The Supreme Court has raised concerns about their exploitation, but previous attempts to create protective laws have failed. Domestic work lacks legal recognition, leaving workers vulnerable. Awareness of existing protections is low, and the caste system complicates the situation. India has yet to ratify ILO&#x27;s Convention 189, which would ensure rights for domestic workers. The lack of action is partly due to conflicts of interest among decision-makers who are also employers.",
