    "news_text": "North Korea's state news agency KCNA reported that the country has revised its constitution to define South Korea as a 'hostile state' during a recent meeting of its legislature. This amendment follows a proposal by Kim Jong Un in January to remove reunification with the South as a national goal. The report coincided with North Korea's destruction of infrastructure linking it to South Korea, which it described as a legitimate measure under the new constitutional definition. Experts suggest this change may allow Kim to justify aggressive actions, including the potential use of nuclear weapons, while also reinforcing his regime's power amid cultural influences from the South. Tensions have escalated recently, with North Korea accusing South Korea of drone incursions and increasing missile tests in response to military collaboration between South Korea and the US. The two Koreas remain technically at war since the Korean War ended with an armistice in 1953.",
