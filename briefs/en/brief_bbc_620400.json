    "news_text": "A second asteroid, smaller than the one that caused the Chicxulub crater, struck the ocean off West Africa 66 million years ago, creating the Nadir crater. This impact likely generated a catastrophic tsunami and a fireball large enough to ignite vegetation far away. The Nadir asteroid, measuring 450-500m wide, hit at approximately 72,000 km/h, but its exact timing relative to the Chicxulub impact remains uncertain. Researchers utilized high-resolution 3D data to study the well-preserved Nadir crater, providing insights into its formation, which is significant as few marine craters have been studied in detail. The findings were published in Nature Communications Earth & Environment.",
