    "news_text": "New data from CoreLogic indicates that approximately 500,000 residential properties in the greater Tampa Bay and Sarasota metro areas are at risk of storm surge flooding due to Hurricane Milton, with an estimated reconstruction cost value (RCV) of $123 billion if it makes landfall as a Category 3 storm. If the hurricane weakens to Category 1, the number of threatened homes could decrease to 225,000, while a strengthening to Category 4 could increase at-risk homes to 700,000 with an RCV of $174 billion. The hurricane's intensity is expected to fluctuate in the next 24 hours, and even minor changes in its landfall location could significantly impact damage levels. The estimates do not include potential damages to commercial properties, which could add another $50 billion in reconstruction costs.",
