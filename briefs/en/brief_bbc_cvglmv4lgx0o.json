    "news_text": "Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, may be resentenced and released on parole following a recommendation from LA County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n. The case, which has drawn renewed attention due to new evidence suggesting the brothers were victims of abuse, has been a focal point in American media and recently inspired a Netflix series. Gasc\u00f3n cited the brothers' difficult upbringing and the need for a review of their life sentences, which they have served for over 30 years. A judge will ultimately decide on the resentencing, and a parole board will evaluate their potential release. The case remains controversial, with mixed reactions from the public and family members. A hearing is scheduled to discuss the resentencing recommendation.",
