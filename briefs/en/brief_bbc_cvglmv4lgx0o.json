    "news_text": "Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were convicted over three decades ago for the murder of their parents, are potentially closer to being released on parole following a recommendation from the Los Angeles County district attorney for resentencing due to new evidence. The case, which has captivated the public and inspired a Netflix series, centers around claims of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse suffered by the brothers, which they argue justified their actions. The new evidence includes a letter from Erik detailing alleged abuse by their father and a claim from a former member of the boy band Menudo regarding sexual assault by Jose Menendez. The brothers, currently serving life sentences without parole, could have a hearing in the coming weeks to discuss their potential release, although the decision will ultimately require approval from a judge and a parole board, with California's governor also having the power to reject it.",
