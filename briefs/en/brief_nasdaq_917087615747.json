    "news_text": "Gold has experienced a remarkable price increase of 30% in the past year, surpassing $2,800 per ounce.

At the Vancouver Resource Investment Conference, experts like Adrian Day, Randy Smallwood, and Ross Beaty discussed the reasons behind this disconnect, attributing it to central banks diversifying away from the US dollar and a lack of interest from traditional investors. They noted that while physical gold prices have soared, equities and ETFs have lagged. The panelists suggested that investors should focus on companies that are de-risking and consider diversifying their portfolios to mitigate risks associated with the gold sector.",
