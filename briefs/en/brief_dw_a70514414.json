    "news_text": "Military juntas in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, which took control between 2021 and 2023, initially gained support by accusing civilian leaders of collusion with France. However, an investigative report reveals that public support for these juntas is waning due to their failure to fulfill promises and the brutal methods employed by Russian mercenaries. The report highlights deteriorating living conditions, increased civilian and military casualties, and a crackdown on dissent. The juntas have formed the Alliance of Sahel States to distance themselves from ECOWAS and France, but this has not led to economic improvement for the citizens. Reports of human rights abuses, including abductions and media suppression, have raised alarms among international observers. Despite promises of security, Russian mercenaries have been linked to atrocities, further complicating the situation.",
