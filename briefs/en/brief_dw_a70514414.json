    "news_header": "Support for military juntas in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger is declining due to unmet promises and harsh tactics by Russian mercenaries, leading to protests and a shift towards anti-Russian sentiments.",
    "news_text": "After military juntas took control in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, they accused civilian leaders of colluding with France to exploit resources. Initially, civilians showed support for the juntas, but recent reports indicate that this support is waning due to the juntas' failure to fulfill promises and the brutal actions of Russian mercenaries against civilians. An investigation by ZAM revealed worsening conditions under military rule, with rising casualties and power outages. The juntas have formed the Alliance of Sahel States, distancing themselves from France and ECOWAS, yet economic prosperity remains elusive. Reports of repression against dissent and media have increased, raising concerns among human rights organizations. The resentment towards France has been exploited by Russia, which has not improved security in the region despite claims of combating terrorism.",
