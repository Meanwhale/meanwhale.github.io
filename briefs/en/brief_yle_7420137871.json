    "news_text": "Tiktok stopped operating in the United States just before a prohibition law took effect. The app is no longer available on Apple and Google stores. The ban is due to national security concerns regarding data collection by its Chinese parent company, Bytedance. Donald Trump, returning as President, hinted at a possible 90-day extension for a sale of Tiktok. Other Bytedance apps have also ceased operations in the US, and some users are migrating to a Chinese app called Xiaohongshu, dubbed 'Tiktok refugees'.",
