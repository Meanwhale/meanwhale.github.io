    "news_text": "According to Statistics Finland, the unemployment rate for individuals aged 15 to 74 was 8.9% in December, with 226,000 unemployed, an increase of 27,000 from the previous year. The number of employed individuals decreased by 56,000, with men and women both seeing declines. The Ministry of Employment reported nearly 322,000 job seekers, 24,000 more than last year. Economist Roope Ohlsbom noted that Finland's weak economic development is affecting the labor market, particularly in construction and private consumption. Although there are some positive signs, such as lower interest rates and a recovery in service exports, consumer confidence remains low, creating a cycle of increasing unemployment and reduced consumption. Jukka Appelqvist from the Chamber of Commerce indicated that while the unemployment situation may have stabilized, the outlook remains bleak, hindering domestic consumption recovery.",
