    "news_text": "Since taking office, the Trump administration has intensified the arrest of undocumented migrants across major US cities, detaining thousands, including both criminals and non-criminals. Raids have occurred in cities like Chicago, New York, Denver, and Los Angeles, causing fear in immigrant communities. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that while priority is given to criminals, all undocumented individuals are at risk of arrest. Over 3,500 migrants have been detained since Trump returned to office, a significant increase compared to the previous administration. The raids are described as 'targeted enforcement operations' aimed at violent offenders, but they have instilled widespread fear, leading many immigrants to avoid work and school. Some migrants, like Gabriela and Carlos, express deep concern for their safety and the safety of their families, fearing deportation and the impact on their communities.",
