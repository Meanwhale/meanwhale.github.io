    "news_text": "A video circulating on social media claims to show Hamas fighters shooting at humanitarian airdrops, suggesting that Hamas is obstructing aid to civilians. The video features unrelated clips edited together, with sound effects added, and does not accurately depict the situation. Fact-checking reveals that the barbershop scene is from an older video, while the airdrop segment has been shared widely without verification. Despite claims of Hamas interference, Israeli officials deny blocking aid, while humanitarian organizations criticize the Israeli government for restricting essential resources in Gaza. The humanitarian crisis continues to escalate amid military operations.",
