    "news_text": "Research indicates that polar bears near Alaska are facing greater exposure to pathogens as climate change alters their habitats. A study published in PLOS ONE reveals that the proportion of bears exposed to certain parasites and bacteria has significantly increased since the 1990s. The Chukchi Sea polar bear population, which has lost substantial sea ice and spends more time on land, is particularly affected. Blood and fecal samples from bears show rising levels of antibodies against diseases such as brucellosis, tularemia, and Toxoplasma gondii. The findings suggest that not only are polar bears at risk, but the entire Arctic food chain may be impacted. Further research is needed to assess the potential risks to humans from these pathogens.",
