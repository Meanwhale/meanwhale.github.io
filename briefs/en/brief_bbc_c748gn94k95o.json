    "news_text": "Google has signed a deal with Kairos Power to use small nuclear reactors to meet the energy demands of its AI data centers, with plans to start using the first reactor this decade and more by 2035. The agreement aims to accelerate the commercialization of advanced nuclear energy, which is seen as a clean and reliable energy source essential for supporting AI technologies. The deal still requires approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and local agencies. As data center energy consumption is expected to double by the end of the decade, the tech industry is increasingly turning to nuclear power to reduce emissions. Critics, however, raise concerns about the risks and radioactive waste associated with nuclear energy.",
