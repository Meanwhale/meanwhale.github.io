    "news_text": "The new electrified railway line from Finland to Haapara in Sweden will be the first to utilize freight trains, with regular services expected to start in Italy this year. A long container train was loaded in Gothenburg, destined for Finland, where Swedish customers will deliver the goods. Although VR Transpoint is currently not involved in transport through Haapara, they are looking into regular container train services. The resumption of freight transport at Haapara was driven by concerns over supply security. The Swedish railway operator is also exploring freight services from Italy, which could benefit Finnish companies by allowing them to transport goods via rail. The Confederation of Finnish Industries is proposing projects to enhance Finland's connections with Central Europe, which could increase competition in the rail sector.",
