    "news_text": "The Los Angeles Equestrian Center became a refuge for hundreds of animals fleeing the Eaton and Palisades fires. Many horses arrived with their owners, while others were brought in by rescuers. The center, which already housed around 500 animals, took in over 200 more in just 24 hours. Volunteers provided care and support, and while most owners were reunited with their animals, some, like a miniature horse named Izzy, remained unclaimed. The experience highlighted the deep bond between humans and their animals amidst the chaos of the fires.",
