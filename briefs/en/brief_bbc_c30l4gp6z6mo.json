    "news_text": "In the past 48 hours, at least 10 Indian flights have received hoax bomb threats, resulting in significant delays and diversions. Notably, Singapore's Air Force dispatched fighter jets to escort an Air India Express flight due to a bomb threat. An Air India flight from Delhi to Chicago was also diverted to a Canadian airport as a precaution. While hoax threats are not uncommon in India, the recent surge is unexplained. Various airlines, including IndiGo, SpiceJet, and Akasa Air, were affected. Police have detained a teenager related to threats made on social media. Air India is cooperating with authorities to identify those responsible and may pursue legal action for damages. Each Indian airport has a Bomb Threat Assessment Committee that evaluates threats, leading to extensive security measures and potential involvement of international agencies. Investigations are ongoing in both Singapore and Canada regarding the threats.",
