    "news_text": "In a thrilling championship game, Canada triumphed over the United States 3-2 in overtime, intensifying their historic rivalry. This match was more than just a game; it occurred against a backdrop of potential trade wars and Donald Trump&#x27;s controversial remarks about annexing Canada. Despite Trump&#x27;s absence, he expressed his hopes for Canada to become the &#x27;51st state.&#x27; Following the victory, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau emphasized national pride, stating, &#x27;You can&#x27;t take our country - and you can&#x27;t take our game.&#x27; The game was a showcase for top NHL talent and a moment for Canadians to unite in pride, especially given the recent tensions over trade tariffs. The rivalry was palpable, with protests against the US anthem and physical altercations on the ice, highlighting the emotional stakes involved. Historically, Canada has dominated in ice hockey, winning 14 out of 20 encounters since 1976, making this victory particularly significant.",
