The summit was attended by leaders from 36 countries, including the UN Secretary General. India, a key member, stands to gain from these developments, leveraging its relationships with new members and balancing ties with both Western and non-Western nations. Despite concerns about Brics becoming anti-West, the group is not inherently opposed to the West, as many new members maintain close ties with Western countries.
