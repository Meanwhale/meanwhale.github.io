    "news_text": "On Sunday, wind power plants in Finland generated a record 6,448 megawatts of electricity, equivalent to the output of four nuclear power plants. This accounted for half of the total electricity produced in the country, which was 12,265 megawatts per hour. Due to the oversupply, hydropower production was minimized, and the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear plant reduced its output. Electricity was also exported to Estonia and Sweden. The maximum wind power capacity in Finland is 7,898 megawatts, and with around 200 new turbines expected to be completed this year, the total capacity will exceed 8,000 megawatts by year-end.",
