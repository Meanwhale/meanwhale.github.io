    "news_text": "As Claudia Sheinbaum takes office as Mexico's first female president on October 1, she faces challenges from Donald Trump's calls for US companies to relocate from Mexico and threats of high tariffs on imports, particularly affecting the electric vehicle sector. Sheinbaum inherits a growing economy, but a recent judicial reform has raised concerns about its impact on democracy and the economy, leading to a freeze of $35 billion in US investments. Despite skepticism from investors and potential threats to the rule of law, Sheinbaum's administration remains optimistic about attracting foreign direct investment. German companies are particularly attentive to the developments, as Mexico is a key production hub for them.",
