    "news_text": "Boeing aims to secure up to $35bn in new funding as a strike by thousands of its workers enters its second month. The company plans to lay off around 17,000 workers, with redundancy notices expected by mid-November. Talks to end the strike collapsed last week after Boeing withdrew a pay rise offer. The company intends to raise $25bn through stock and debt offerings and has arranged to borrow up to $10bn from banks. Despite the layoffs, which will be compulsory with severance payments, striking workers will not be affected for now. Boeing's shares rose by 2.2% following the funding announcements, although the company anticipates a loss for the last quarter. The ongoing strike, costing an estimated $1bn monthly, has raised concerns for the US economy and prompted discussions between labor officials and Boeing executives.",
