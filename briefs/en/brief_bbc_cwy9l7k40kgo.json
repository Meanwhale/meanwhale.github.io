    "news_text": "Boeing aims to secure up to $35 billion in new funding as a strike by thousands of its workers enters its second month. The company plans to lay off around 17,000 workers, with redundancy notices expected in mid-November. Talks to end the strike collapsed last week after Boeing withdrew a pay rise offer. The company intends to raise $25 billion through stock and debt offerings and has secured a deal to borrow up to $10 billion from banks. Boeing's shares rose by 2.2% following the announcements. The layoffs will not initially affect striking workers, and severance payments will be offered. Additionally, deliveries of the 777X planes will be delayed by a year. The strike is estimated to cost Boeing around $1 billion a month, raising concerns for the US economy and prompting discussions between labor representatives and Boeing executives.",
