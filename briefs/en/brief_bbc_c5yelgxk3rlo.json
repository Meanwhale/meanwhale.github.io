    "news_text": "US President Donald Trump has announced plans to build a migrant detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, capable of holding up to 30,000 individuals. This facility, separate from the existing military prison, is intended for 'the worst criminal illegal aliens.' The expansion of the current facility will be managed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and migrants may be transported there after being intercepted at sea. The announcement coincided with the signing of the Laken Riley Act, which mandates that undocumented immigrants arrested for serious crimes be held in jail until trial. The Cuban government condemned the plan, labeling it as torture and illegal detention on occupied land.",
