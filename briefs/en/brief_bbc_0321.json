    "news_text": "Creditors of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX are expected to receive up to $16.5 billion under a bankruptcy plan approved in the US. This plan concludes the bankruptcy saga that began in November 2022, when FTX's former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted of stealing customer funds and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Former customers will recover approximately 119% of their account balances at the time of bankruptcy, with funds expected to be distributed 60 days after the plan's effective date. John J Ray III, the appointed lawyer and current CEO, described the approval as a significant milestone, aiming to return 100% of bankruptcy claims plus interest to non-governmental creditors. FTX had reported around $8 billion in missing customer funds at the time of bankruptcy, but has since recovered assets valued between $14.7 billion and $16.5 billion. The plan allows for customer repayments before other unsecured creditors, though some former customers have expressed dissatisfaction, noting that cash repayments do not reflect the current value of their crypto holdings, which have increased significantly since the collapse.",
