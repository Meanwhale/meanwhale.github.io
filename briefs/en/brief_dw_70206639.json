    "news_text": "UniCredit surprised the market by acquiring a 9% stake in Commerzbank for \u20ac700 million, later increasing its total ownership to 21% through additional purchases. The Italian bank has requested ECB permission to raise its stake to 29.9%, just below the threshold for a mandatory public offer. This move has unsettled the German government, which has expressed opposition to any takeover, emphasizing Commerzbank's importance to the German economy. Unions have also voiced concerns about the impact of a merger on jobs and services. UniCredit's CEO Andrea Orcel is known for his aggressive deal-making style, and the situation has reignited discussions about consolidation in Europe's banking sector, despite regulatory challenges.",
