    "news_text": "Netflix has begun increasing subscription prices in various countries, including Japan, parts of Europe, and the Middle East and Africa, as growth from its password-sharing crackdown diminishes. The company reported adding 5.1 million subscribers from July to September, the smallest increase in over a year, and is under pressure to demonstrate future growth potential. Despite this, Netflix's revenue rose by 15% to over $9.8 billion, and profit increased from $1.6 billion to $2.3 billion year-over-year. The ad-supported streaming option has gained traction, accounting for 50% of new sign-ups in regions where it's available. Analysts suggest that Netflix's ability to produce new content will be crucial for maintaining subscriber value and justifying price increases.",
