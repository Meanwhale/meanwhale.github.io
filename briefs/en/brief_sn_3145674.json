    "news_text": "Research indicates that the enzyme ALDH3A2 is essential for the color variation in parrot feathers, particularly in transforming red aldehyde molecules into yellow carboxylic acids. This process fine-tunes the vibrant colors of parrot plumage, which is influenced by pigments called psittacofulvins. The study found that ALDH3A2 is more active in yellow and green feathers, suggesting its role in color swapping. The findings raise questions about the advantages of psittacofulvins over carotenoids, as they may provide more durable feather colors.",
