    "news_text": "An expert highlights that Finland&#x27;s product branding is underdeveloped compared to other Nordic countries, with exports declining. While service exports are growing, they still lag behind goods. The CEO of Etla emphasizes the need for Finland to invest more in intangible assets and skilled labor, particularly in design and management. He argues that Finland should focus on specialized products for global markets rather than competing on volume and price. The potential for green energy and bioproducts could lead to a new wave of industrialization, creating jobs and boosting exports. A comprehensive approach to industrial policy is essential for a successful green transition.",
