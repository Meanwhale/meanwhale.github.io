    "news_text": "On a warm autumn day in Bucharest, the trial of Andrew and Tristan Tate, controversial social media influencers charged with human trafficking and abuse of women, has been postponed again. The brothers, who have millions of followers and a history of misogynistic statements, were arrested in Romania in late 2022. Despite their arrests, the Romanian justice system has been slow to process their case, with repeated delays and a lack of accountability for abusers. Reports indicate that Romania has a significant problem with human trafficking, particularly affecting women. The Tates' case reflects broader issues within the Romanian legal system regarding the treatment of such crimes.",
