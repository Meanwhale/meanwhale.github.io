    "news_header": "US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth stated in Brussels that Ukraine&#x27;s goal of reclaiming its former borders is unrealistic. He emphasized that Europe must take responsibility for its own defense and increase military spending. Hegseth clarified that Ukraine is not expected to join NATO soon, and if it does not become a member, it cannot rely on NATO&#x27;s collective defense. He urged Ukraine to abandon the pursuit of the 2014 borders to avoid prolonging the conflict. The US aims for a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine, but European nations must lead in defense efforts and funding.",
