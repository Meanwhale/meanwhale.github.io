    "news_text": "Haminan Energia has been compelled to sell its electricity and district heating networks following failed LNG gas deals and a lack of city financing. The sale to Capman Infra has raised suspicions regarding board member Jan Montell's impartiality, as he is connected to the buyer through his role at Skarta Energy, which is majority-owned by Capman Infra. Despite this, Montell claims no conflict of interest exists. Legal opinions suggest he is not disqualified from the decision-making process, as the Companies Act's disqualification rules are less strict than those for local government. Key city officials were reportedly unaware of Montell's ties to Capman Infra. The sale has sparked public opposition, with nearly 400 signatures collected against it, as residents are concerned about selling essential municipal infrastructure to a private investment fund.",
