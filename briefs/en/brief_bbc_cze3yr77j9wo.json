    "news_text": "Donald Trump has achieved a decisive victory over Kamala Harris in the recent election, garnering 72,631,585 votes (50.8%) compared to Harris's 67,905,673 votes (47.5%). Trump's success was bolstered by strong support from white working-class voters, a significant increase in Latino votes, and improved performance among younger voters. He won key battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, which were crucial for the Democrats in the previous election. Trump's messaging on the economy, particularly regarding inflation, resonated with many voters who felt disillusioned by the Democratic party's handling of economic issues.",
