    "news_text": "Steve Corrick, owner of a small teashop in Somerset, has called on the Chancellor to revise VAT regulations that force him to limit his cafe's operating days to avoid exceeding the \u00a390,000 turnover threshold. Exceeding this limit would require him to charge VAT on all sales, making the business financially unviable. He argues that the current tax structure, often referred to as 'the cliff edge', discourages small businesses from growing. A survey by the Federation of Small Businesses revealed that many firms face similar challenges due to these rules. Corrick emphasizes the need for reform to support small businesses and prevent them from being held back.",
