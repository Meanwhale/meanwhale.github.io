    "news_text": "The HBO documentary 'Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery' suggests that Peter Todd, a Canadian crypto expert, is the real Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious inventor of Bitcoin. This claim has sparked significant interest, with over $44 million in bets placed on the crypto betting site Polymarket regarding Satoshi's identity. Todd, a prominent Bitcoin developer, has rejected the suggestion, stating he is not Satoshi and attributing his posting history to being too busy with school and work. Previous candidates for Satoshi's identity have included Dorian Nakamoto and Craig Wright, both of whom have been debunked. The allure of Satoshi's anonymity remains a key aspect of Bitcoin's appeal.",
