    "news_text": "TikTok has dismissed a Bloomberg report suggesting that China is considering allowing a sale of its US operations to Elon Musk, labeling it as 'pure fiction'. This comes as the US Supreme Court is set to rule on a law that could force TikTok to sell its US operations or face a ban by January 19. TikTok has consistently stated it will not sell its US operations. The report indicated that one scenario being considered by Chinese officials could involve Musk's X social media platform taking control of TikTok's US operations. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has urged the Supreme Court to delay its decision, seeking a political resolution after he takes office. Two Democratic lawmakers have also called for an extension of the deadline. The Biden administration has raised national security concerns regarding TikTok's operations.",
