    "news_text": "Since early 2024, the U.S. has reported 66 human cases of H5N1 bird flu, mainly among dairy farm workers exposed to infected cattle. The outbreak, which began in late 2023, has not been effectively contained, and the USDA's response has been criticized as inadequate. Researchers warn that the virus could mutate and increase its pandemic potential, especially if it reassorts with seasonal flu viruses. The need for better protective measures and vaccination for farm workers is emphasized, as well as the importance of monitoring and preparedness in light of the incoming administration's stance on vaccines.",
