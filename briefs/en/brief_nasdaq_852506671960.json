    "news_text": "In 2025, IPO activity is projected to increase, driven by anticipated policy changes under Trump and a favorable business climate. Investment bankers are preparing for a resurgence in deal-making, supported by a robust lineup of anticipated IPOs. Economic confidence is expected to accelerate capital market activity, with Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon noting the end of a multi-year IPO drought. Proceeds from U.S. IPOs are expected to rise due to monetary easing, and a less restrictive regulatory environment under Trump&#x27;s administration could further boost the IPO market. However, potential headwinds include higher federal spending and inflation risks. Various ETFs are positioned to benefit from the anticipated IPO market growth.",
