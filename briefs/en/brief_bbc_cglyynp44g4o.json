    "news_text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised its growth forecast for the UK economy to 1.6% for this year, up from 1.5%. However, it cautioned that incoming US President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could escalate trade tensions, reduce investment, and disrupt global supply chains. While Trump's economic strategies may provide short-term boosts, they could lead to long-term negative consequences. The IMF also noted that the UK economy is expected to outperform several European economies over the next two years. Despite the upgrade, UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves acknowledged the need for more action to stimulate growth. The IMF's report highlights the uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies and their potential impact on global economic stability.",
