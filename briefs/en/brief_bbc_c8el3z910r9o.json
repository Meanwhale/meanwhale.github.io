    "news_text": "The government is set to raise inheritance tax revenue at the Budget, with potential changes to current exemptions and reliefs. Inheritance tax is levied at 40% on estates exceeding \u00a3325,000, generating around \u00a37bn annually, affecting about 4% of deaths. Ministers aim to address a \u00a340bn fiscal shortfall, emphasizing the need for a 'reset in public finances.' The Budget, titled 'Fixing the Foundations to Deliver Change,' may also see increases in National Insurance for employers, despite prior commitments not to raise taxes on working individuals. The Chancellor is expected to adjust borrowing rules and lower departmental budgets, amid criticism from the opposition regarding transparency on tax increases.",
