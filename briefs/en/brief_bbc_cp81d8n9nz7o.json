    "news_text": "Kamel Daoud has made history as the first Algerian author to win the prestigious Goncourt literary prize with his novel 'Houris', which depicts the brutal civil war in Algeria during the 1990s. The story follows Fajr, a survivor of Islamist violence, who shares her traumatic experiences with her unborn child. Despite the book's significance in addressing the suffering of women during this dark period, it faces challenges in Algeria, including a lack of local publishers and potential legal repercussions for discussing the civil war. Daoud, who has lived in Paris since 2020, hopes his work will inspire reflection on freedom and the importance of confronting Algeria's history.",
