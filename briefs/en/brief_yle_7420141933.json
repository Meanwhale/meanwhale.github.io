    "news_text": "The value of Trump's meme currency has fallen to one third of its peak. Professor Timo Rothovius describes cryptocurrencies as akin to a pyramid scheme, emphasizing their speculative nature. Ville Kuusela, who invested in Trump coins shortly after their launch, experienced a rapid rise and fall in value. While Kuusela profited by selling at the right time, many buyers have seen their investments lose value. Rothovius notes that the primary value of meme coins is based on speculation rather than fundamental factors, and warns of the high risks involved in trading them.",
