    "news_header": "UN experts condemn human rights violations against migrants in Tunisia, highlighting violence and dangerous interception practices.",
    "news_text": "A UN report describes shocking human rights violations against migrants in Tunisia, including physical violence and dangerous interception at sea. Between January and July, 189 migrants died attempting to cross the Mediterranean, with 265 fatalities during interception operations. The report indicates that migrants, particularly from sub-Saharan Africa, face heightened violence and are often obstructed from receiving aid. Despite these allegations, Tunisia is still considered a safe country by EU nations, which have strengthened migration control cooperation with the Tunisian government under President Kais Saied. Human rights organizations criticize this partnership, claiming it contributes to ongoing violations. The EU has called for an investigation into the treatment of migrants, but Tunisia has not responded to these requests.",
