    "news_text": "Charities and energy providers have criticized Ofgem&#x27;s plans to change the way standing charges are paid, arguing it complicates billing and remains unfair. Many billpayers oppose fixed daily charges, which have increased significantly, and express concern about affordability, especially for vulnerable customers. Ofgem&#x27;s proposal aims to offer a no standing charge option but has faced backlash for potentially hiding costs within unit rates.",
