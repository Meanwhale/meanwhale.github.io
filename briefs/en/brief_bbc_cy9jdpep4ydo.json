    "news_text": "As the UN biodiversity summit COP 16 concludes, scientists warn of insufficient progress in saving nature, with political ambition failing to address the economic costs of environmental destruction. Representatives from 196 countries gathered in Cali, Colombia, to discuss halting biodiversity decline by 2030, but many failed to present detailed plans. The summit highlights the urgent need for coordinated action as one million species face extinction. Experts emphasize that without prioritizing nature, risks will escalate. The next summit is scheduled for 2026, and Dr. Jane Goodall warns that our future is at risk if biodiversity loss is not addressed.",
