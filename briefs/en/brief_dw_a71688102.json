    "news_text": "The recent African Union (AU) summit in Addis Ababa saw Mahmoud Ali Youssouf elected as the new head of the AU&#x27;s executive commission, replacing Moussa Faki. Youssouf, the first leader from East Africa, faced tough competition against veteran politician Raila Odinga, ultimately securing two-thirds support from regional leaders. His election comes at a time when Africa grapples with numerous armed conflicts reminiscent of the post-Cold War era. Analysts highlight the importance of unity among African nations to develop a common agenda, while also noting the challenges posed by internal divisions and funding issues within the AU. The summit coincided with a shift in Western support for the AU, raising concerns about future funding and effectiveness. The AU aims to focus on reparations for Africans and people of African descent by 2025, but faces significant hurdles in gaining support from European nations and the US, especially amid rising far-right sentiments.",
