    "news_text": "Eric Council Jr, a 25-year-old from Athens, Georgia, was arrested for his involvement in a hack of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) X account, where a fake post about Bitcoin led to a significant price surge. Court documents reveal that he searched for information on being investigated by the FBI and used various online aliases. The hack, which occurred in January, exploited a lack of security measures after the SEC had removed multi-factor authentication. Council is charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud, facing up to five years in prison if convicted.",
