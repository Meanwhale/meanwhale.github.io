    "news_header": "India's coal-based electricity production is declining, marking a significant shift in its energy landscape.",
    "news_text": "India produces two-thirds of its electricity from coal, but a turning point is emerging as coal power generation decreased in August and September compared to the previous year. This marks the first decline after 47 consecutive months of growth. The drop in coal electricity production was 4.9% in August and 5.8% in September, attributed to a rainy monsoon season reducing air conditioning needs and increasing hydropower output. Additionally, India's renewable energy sources, particularly solar power, saw significant growth, contributing to 13.9% of electricity production this quarter, alongside an increase in nuclear power generation.",
