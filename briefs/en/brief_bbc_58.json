    "news_text": "Starting 31 October, eBay will limit the sale of e-bikes and e-bike batteries in the UK to eligible business sellers, following a rise in battery-related fires. The London Fire Brigade reported a 78% increase in e-bike fires in 2023, prompting safety warnings. A coroner previously called for government action after a fatal incident involving an overheating battery. eBay emphasized consumer safety and plans to audit sellers for safety compliance. The charity Electrical Safety First supports this policy change but advocates for new laws to ensure product safety. The Product Regulation and Metrology Bill is under consideration in Parliament to address these concerns.",
