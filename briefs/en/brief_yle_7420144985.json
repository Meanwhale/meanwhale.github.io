    "news_text": "The tax administration has noted a dramatic increase in preliminary rulings regarding share exchanges, with figures rising from 566 to 1,152 in one year. This surge has raised concerns among taxpayers and organizations like Finnwatch, who argue that the situation is unsustainable and indicative of aggressive tax planning strategies. Many companies are reportedly overvaluing shares to gain tax benefits, with significant increases in overvaluation amounts. While the tax administration acknowledges the rise in interest and inquiries, it can only intervene in the most blatant cases of tax manipulation. Finnwatch and the tax administration agree that public awareness has contributed to the increased demand for holding arrangements, which allow for tax minimization. The Minister of Finance has indicated plans to address these loopholes in legislation.",
