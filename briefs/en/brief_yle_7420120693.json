    "news_text": "The cybersecurity group has discussed significant safety risks associated with damages to fiber networks in Finland, highlighting that while laws require careful checks by contractors, enforcement is challenging. Reports indicate that some companies disregard regulations, leading to damage to critical infrastructure like heating, electricity, and telecommunications. Lauri Mu.n from the Ministry of Transport and Communications emphasized the responsibility of builders to adhere to rules. The Finnish Transport and Communications Agency's Cybersecurity Centre is addressing these issues, but municipalities struggle to monitor compliance due to the rapid expansion of fiber networks. A reform of the Act on Structural Construction is underway but won't be implemented until 2026. The Ministry aims for efficient and flexible fiber network development, while safety concerns persist, particularly regarding potential hazards near gas pipelines and electric cables. Although individual incidents may not cause widespread issues, simultaneous failures could pose significant risks to essential services.",
