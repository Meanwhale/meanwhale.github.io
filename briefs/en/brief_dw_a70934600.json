    "news_original_title": "BRICS currency: Is Trump's tariff threat justified?",
    "news_text": "President Trump has reiterated his threat to impose a 100% tariff on imports from BRICS nations if they continue efforts to establish a reserve currency to compete with the US dollar. This warning, shared on his Truth Social platform, follows similar remarks made after his election victory in November 2024. Trump emphasized that there is 'no chance' for BRICS to replace the dollar in international trade, warning that countries attempting to do so would face tariffs. The BRICS nations, which include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and recently expanded to include Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the UAE, are looking to reduce their reliance on the dollar, which dominates global trade. Economists note that the dollar's dominance provides the US with significant economic advantages and geopolitical influence. Discussions about a new joint currency have gained momentum, particularly after sanctions on Russia, but the complexities of differing political and economic systems among BRICS members pose challenges. While some leaders advocate for a new currency, others, like India, are more cautious. The creation of a joint currency would likely take years and could resemble the IMF's Special Drawing Rights, but progress has been slow.",
