    "news_text": "According to the Ministry of Defense, Finland will engage in maritime surveillance in the North Atlantic and participate in air policing over Iceland next year. Five fighter jets and about 50 personnel will be deployed for this mission. NATO countries are responsible for Iceland's air policing, as the country lacks its own fighter jets. Finnish forces will patrol in Iceland, the Northeast Atlantic, and the Arctic Ocean in February and March 2025, with both regular and contracted personnel involved. Additionally, Finnish soldiers will take part in NATO's maritime surveillance in the North Atlantic, the North Sea, and the Baltic Sea for three months, deploying a Katanp\u00e4\u00e4-class vessel and around 40 personnel. Defense Minister Antti H\u00e4kk\u00e4nen stated that Finland is demonstrating responsibility by participating in peacetime missions. This year, Finland has monitored Romanian airspace with fighter jets and maritime areas in the Baltic Sea with ships. The Finnish Parliament will discuss the deployment for peacetime missions in October. However, Finland does not plan to send land forces for these missions due to its location on NATO's eastern flank and the complexities of mobilizing reserve personnel. Previously, Finnish Air Force participated in NATO's partnership in Iceland, focusing on unarmed training rather than actual air policing. This new mission marks Finland's first engagement through NATO for regular air policing.",
