    "news_text": "The AA has called for new regulations for drivers under 21, suggesting they should not carry passengers of a similar age for the first six months after passing their driving test. This proposal, which includes penalties for not wearing seatbelts, aims to prevent serious injuries and save lives on UK roads. The idea is inspired by existing graduated driving licensing (GDL) measures in Northern Ireland, which have shown a significant reduction in road incidents. Despite the Department for Transport currently not considering these measures, advocates like Crystal Owen, who lost her son in a car crash, argue that such changes are crucial for protecting young drivers and their passengers. The AA emphasizes the need for action, citing statistics on road fatalities involving young drivers, while the DfT acknowledges the issue but is exploring other solutions.",
