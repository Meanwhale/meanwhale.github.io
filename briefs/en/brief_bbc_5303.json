    "news_text": "The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has released the Living Planet Report, indicating a severe decline in global wildlife populations, which have decreased by an average of 73% in the last 50 years. Key threats include habitat degradation, overexploitation, invasive species, disease, climate change, and pollution. While there are isolated conservation successes, such as the increase in mountain gorilla populations, these are overshadowed by widespread habitat destruction. The report warns that nature loss and climate change are pushing ecosystems towards irreversible tipping points, including the potential collapse of the Amazon rainforest. WWF emphasizes the urgent need for collective action from world leaders to address these challenges, especially as nearly 200 countries prepare for the UN Biodiversity Conference to discuss restoring nature.",
