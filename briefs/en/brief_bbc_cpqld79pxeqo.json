    "news_text": "President-elect Donald Trump would have been convicted of illegally trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election results if he had not been re-elected in 2024, according to Special Counsel Jack Smith. Smith stated that the evidence against Trump was sufficient for a conviction, but the prosecution was halted due to the US Constitution's prohibition against prosecuting a sitting president. Trump denied any wrongdoing and claimed the findings were false. After his 2024 election victory, the legal issues he faced largely disappeared, leading to the dismissal of the interference case. The report detailing these findings was released to Congress, further explaining the decision to close the case.",
