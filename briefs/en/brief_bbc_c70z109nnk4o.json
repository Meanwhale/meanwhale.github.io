    "news_text": "The newly constructed railway terminal in Dar es Salaam, designed to resemble the tanzanite gemstone, represents Tanzania's transportation goals. The electric trains, a first for the region, connect Dar es Salaam to Dodoma in under four hours, halving the road travel time. This is part of a larger 2,560km Standard Gauge Railway project aimed at linking major cities and neighboring countries. The service has quickly gained popularity, with over 7,000 passengers daily, leading to plans for more trips. The train offers a comfortable travel experience, contrasting sharply with the older services. However, the project faced delays and significant costs, with funding from various sources. While the railway has improved travel for many, it has negatively impacted local bus services, highlighting the mixed effects of such developments.",
