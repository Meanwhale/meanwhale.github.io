    "news_text": "Brazil's Supreme Court has lifted a ban on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, after the company paid fines totaling 28 million reais ($5.1m) and blocked accounts spreading misinformation. Justice Alexandre de Moraes authorized the platform's return following its compliance with court orders. X, owned by Elon Musk, had previously defied the court, leading to a nationwide ban. The telecoms watchdog Anatel has been instructed to ensure service resumes for over 20 million users within 24 hours. X expressed pride in returning to Brazil, emphasizing the importance of access for its users in the country, which is its largest market in Latin America.",
