    "news_text": "At the end of Q3, Stora Enso showed year-on-year improvement, with a focus on addressing environmental damage in Finland. CEO Hans Sohlstr\u00f6m announced measures to prevent future incidents and expressed regret over the company's reputation. Financially, the company reported net sales of approximately EUR 2.3 billion, a 6% increase from the previous year, and an adjusted operating result of EUR 175 million. However, Stora Enso expects market recovery to slow down due to weak demand in consumer packaging and construction sectors. The company is building a new production line in Oulu and plans to import eucalyptus pulp from South America, while also focusing on sustainable wood products that store carbon.",
