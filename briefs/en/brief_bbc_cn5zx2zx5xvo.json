    "news_text": "Recent floods in Central Europe, caused by Storm Boris, resulted in at least 24 deaths and significant damage, with scientists attributing the severity to climate change. The World Weather Attribution group noted that the intense rainfall was made twice as likely by climate change, with the storm being the rainiest four-day period ever recorded in the region. While the storm was well-forecasted, allowing for better preparation, the increasing frequency and intensity of such weather events are concerning. Climate change is expected to make similar rainfall events more common and severe, particularly if global warming reaches 2C or more. Improved flood defenses have helped mitigate impacts, but rising temperatures may render them ineffective in the future. Experts emphasize the need for ambitious climate action to limit emissions and prevent worsening flood damage.",
