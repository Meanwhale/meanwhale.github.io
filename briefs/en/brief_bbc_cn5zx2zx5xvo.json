    "news_text": "Storm Boris has severely impacted Central Europe, particularly Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Austria, and Italy, resulting in at least 24 deaths and billions in damages. Climate change has intensified the storm's rainfall, making such extreme weather events more likely. The World Weather Attribution group noted that recent rainfall was the heaviest recorded in the region, with climate change doubling its likelihood. While improved forecasting allowed for better preparedness, concerns remain about future flooding as temperatures rise. Scientists warn that without significant climate action, extreme weather events will become more frequent and intense, with potential future warming reaching 3C by century's end. Enhanced flood defenses have mitigated some impacts, but ongoing climate change poses a risk of overwhelming these measures.",
