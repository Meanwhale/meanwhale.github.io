    "news_header": "Volkswagen faces significant challenges, including potential plant closures and job cuts, due to declining sales and high production costs, while negotiations for worker wages intensify amid economic uncertainty.",
    "news_text": "Volkswagen is experiencing a crisis as it plans to close one or two car plants in Germany and cut thousands of jobs due to falling sales, which has created uncertainty for its 120,000 employees. The company, which has historically enjoyed higher wages and job security, is now facing significant challenges from rising costs and competition, particularly in the EV market from Chinese manufacturers. Despite posting profits of over \u20ac18 billion in 2023, VW management has initiated an efficiency program to save \u20ac10 billion by 2026. The situation is further complicated by the EU's stringent climate goals, which could lead to substantial fines for failing to meet emissions targets. As negotiations for a 7% wage increase begin, VW's management highlights the high labor costs in Germany as a critical issue, while workers argue that management's past errors should not impact their job security.",
