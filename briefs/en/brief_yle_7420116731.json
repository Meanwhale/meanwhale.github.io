    "news_text": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's approval ratings have significantly dropped since he took office, with a recent YouGov poll indicating that 63% of Britons view him negatively, compared to only 27% who have a favorable opinion. This marks the lowest popularity for Starmer since 2021. Following the parliamentary elections in July, Starmer was relatively popular, but his image has deteriorated due to controversies over expensive gifts from donors and the government's cancellation of winter heating support for pensioners. Although Starmer is currently less popular than the controversial Nigel Farage, Farage evokes even stronger negative feelings among respondents. In comparison, both Starmer and Farage are less unpopular than Conservative leader Rishi Sunak, while Ed Davey of the Liberal Democrats has the least negative perceptions among party leaders.",
