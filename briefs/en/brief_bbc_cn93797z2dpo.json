After funding a private mission to space in 2021, he has since engaged in further space adventures, including a commercial spacewalk. Recently nominated by Donald Trump to lead NASA, Isaacman&#x27;s appointment raises questions about the agency&#x27;s direction and its reliance on private sector innovations.
