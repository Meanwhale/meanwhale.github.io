    "news_text": "A study led by Erica Hartmann at Northwestern University found over 600 unique viral species on showerheads and toothbrushes in American homes, primarily bacteriophages that infect bacteria rather than humans. This research emphasizes the importance of understanding microbial communities in living spaces, as most viruses are not harmful and can potentially aid in bacterial infection treatments. The findings suggest that embracing these microbes could lead to better cleaning methods and insights into environmental health. The study builds on previous research into bathroom microbiomes and aims to explore the functions of these viruses further.",
