    "news_header": "The Finnish government is considering reducing the number of state-owned airports due to profitability issues and is exploring privatization options.",
    "news_text": "The Finnish government plans to abandon unprofitable airports and may significantly reduce the number of state-owned domestic airports by the 2030s. The Ministry of Transport and Communications is working on a classification for airports of national importance and has sent a draft Transport 12 Plan for feedback. Finavia, the state-owned airport company, will continue operations at key airports but may phase out others after 2027 due to decreased international passenger flow. The government is also looking into privatization and partnerships with municipalities or companies to maintain regional airports. Discussions on these changes are expected in the spring, and the government aims to ensure connectivity for airports that may lose direct flights to Helsinki.",
