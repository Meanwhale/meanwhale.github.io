    "news_text": "In April, the United States issued a warning to Israel, demanding improvements in the humanitarian situation in Gaza, specifically allowing more food, medicine, and vaccines. The U.S. requires Israel to permit at least 350 aid workers daily through all crossing points and to open a fifth crossing. U.S. officials noted that current aid delivery is insufficient, with less than half of the necessary aid cycles being completed. The situation in Gaza is dire, with residents reporting severe food shortages and humanitarian aid being critically low. The U.S. has also pledged military support to Israel while the United Nations warns of catastrophic food security consequences due to the ongoing conflict.",
