    "news_text": "In 2025, IPO activity is projected to increase, driven by anticipated policy changes under Trump and a favorable business climate. Investment bankers are preparing for a resurgence in dealmaking, supported by a robust lineup of IPOs. Economic confidence is expected to accelerate capital market activity, with Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon noting the end of a multi-year IPO drought. Proceeds from U.S. IPOs are expected to rise due to monetary easing, and the incoming Trump administration&#x27;s plans for lower corporate taxes and deregulation could further boost the IPO market. However, potential headwinds include higher federal spending and inflation risks. Various ETFs are highlighted as smart investment options for exposure to the anticipated IPO market recovery.",
