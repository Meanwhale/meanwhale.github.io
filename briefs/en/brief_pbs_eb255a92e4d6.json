    "news_original_title": "Russia appears to have time on its side nearly 3 years after it invaded Ukraine",
    "news_text": "Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the conflict has escalated into Europe&#x27;s largest war since WWII, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and millions of refugees. President Putin aimed for a swift victory, but Ukraine&#x27;s resistance and counteroffensives have complicated the situation. As U.S. officials engage in talks with Russia, Trump has altered the U.S. stance on NATO, suggesting Ukraine may not join. Despite setbacks, Russia has made territorial gains and continues to pressure Ukraine. Zelenskyy insists on Ukraine&#x27;s NATO aspirations and security guarantees while rejecting any agreements without Kyiv&#x27;s involvement. The future remains uncertain, with potential elections in Ukraine and ongoing Russian demands.",
