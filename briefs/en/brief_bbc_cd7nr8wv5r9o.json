    "news_text": "Engineers at Sierra Space are conducting experiments to develop a machine that can extract oxygen from lunar regolith, a crucial resource for future astronauts on the moon. The machine has been tested in a vacuum chamber simulating lunar conditions and is designed to produce oxygen for breathing and rocket fuel. While challenges remain, including the effects of lunar gravity, researchers are optimistic about the potential for in-situ resource utilization on the moon, which could significantly reduce mission costs and support long-term human presence.",
