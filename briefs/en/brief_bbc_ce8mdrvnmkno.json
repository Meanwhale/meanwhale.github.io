    "news_text": "California Governor Gavin Newsom has requested $40 billion from the federal government to aid in the recovery of Los Angeles areas affected by January&#x27;s fires, which destroyed 37,469 acres and resulted in 26 fatalities. The funds will support immediate and long-term recovery efforts, including workforce recovery, tax incentives, and property redevelopment. Newsom emphasized the need for public assistance in debris removal and repair, noting the extensive devastation and economic impact on California. Approximately 150,000 residents have been displaced. The request has garnered support from some lawmakers, although its reception in Congress remains uncertain, especially given the Republican majority. President Trump previously expressed skepticism about federal aid for California until water supply issues are addressed.",
