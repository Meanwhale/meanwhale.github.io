    "news_text": "According to a new study by the European Union's Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), Muslims are the most affected by racism in Germany, Austria, and Finland, with almost half facing discrimination regularly. The study, which surveyed 9,600 participants across 13 EU countries between 2021 and 2022, highlights a worrying rise in anti-Muslim sentiment, exacerbated by conflicts in the Middle East. The FRA noted that the increase in hatred towards Muslims began before the recent Hamas attack on Israel and intensified afterward, with reports of anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim acts rising in several EU countries. Discrimination is also influenced by factors such as skin color and ethnicity, with Muslim women, particularly those wearing religious clothing, being especially vulnerable.",
