    "news_text": "The California Association of Realtors (C.A.R.) has released its 2025 housing and economic forecast, indicating a more favorable interest rate environment that will alleviate the 'lock-in' effect, leading to improved housing inventory. Existing single-family home sales are projected to rise by 10.5% in 2025, reaching 304,400 units, with median home prices expected to increase by 4.6% to $909,400. Lower borrowing costs and increased homes for sale are anticipated to attract more buyers and sellers, particularly first-time buyers. The U.S. GDP is forecast to slow to 1.1%, and California's job growth is expected to dip slightly. While inventory is expected to improve, demand will also rise, keeping the market competitive.",
