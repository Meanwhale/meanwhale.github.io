    "news_text": "The California Association of Realtors (C.A.R.) has released its 2025 housing and economic forecast, predicting a more favorable interest rate environment that will alleviate the current 'lock-in' effect, leading to improved housing inventory. Existing single-family home sales are projected to rise by 10.5% in 2025, reaching 304,400 units, while the median home price is expected to increase by 4.6% to $909,400. Lower borrowing costs and an increase in homes for sale are anticipated to attract more buyers and sellers, particularly first-time buyers. The U.S. GDP is forecast to slow to 1.1%, and California's nonfarm job growth is expected to dip to 1.1%. Housing supply is expected to improve gradually, with active listings projected to grow by just over 10%. Despite a competitive market, home prices are expected to rise modestly due to ongoing housing shortages.",
