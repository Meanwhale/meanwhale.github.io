    "news_text": "U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy expressed skepticism about Russia&#x27;s willingness to pursue peace in Ukraine following a G20 meeting in Johannesburg. After listening to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov&#x27;s speech, Lammy noted a lack of genuine desire for peace from Russia. He criticized Lavrov&#x27;s remarks as imperialistic and called for sympathy towards the victims of aggression. The G20 meeting, which included major economies, struggled to find consensus on global issues, further complicated by the ongoing war in Ukraine and U.S.-Russia tensions. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa emphasized the need for serious dialogue amidst geopolitical tensions. The absence of key U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, raised concerns about the G20&#x27;s effectiveness in fostering international cooperation.",
