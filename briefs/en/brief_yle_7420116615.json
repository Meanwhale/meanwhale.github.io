    "news_text": "Following the Nobel Prize announcements, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Nobel Prize for Protein Research to David Baker, who shared the prize with Demis Hassabis and John M. Jumper. The latter two developed an AI model, AlphaFold2, to predict complex protein structures, addressing a 50-year-old scientific challenge. Baker recounted the excitement of receiving the call about the award while asleep. The advancements in AI have significantly enhanced the understanding of proteins, which can lead to breakthroughs in medicine and other fields. The Nobel Prize week continues with announcements for Literature, Peace, and Economics, culminating in a gala in December where winners will receive their medals and honors.",
