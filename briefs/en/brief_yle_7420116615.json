    "news_text": "Following the announcement of the Nobel Prizes in Science, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to David Baker, who developed entirely new proteins, and shared by Demis Hassabis and John M. Jumper for creating an AI model that solves a long-standing problem in predicting complex protein structures. Baker, a professor at the University of Washington, expressed excitement about the recognition, highlighting how AI has significantly enhanced the development of new proteins that can be used in medicines and vaccines. The announcement follows other Nobel awards in Medicine and Physics, with more literary and peace prizes to be revealed soon. The laureates will receive their medals and certificates in December during the Nobel Gala in Stockholm.",
