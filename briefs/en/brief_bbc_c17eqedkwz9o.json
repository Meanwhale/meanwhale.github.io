    "news_text": "A tanker exploded in Nigeria after crashing and spilling fuel, resulting in 77 deaths and 25 injuries. The incident occurred in Suleja, North Central Niger state, shortly after people began gathering fuel. Fuel tanker accidents are frequent in Nigeria due to poor road conditions and vehicle maintenance. Recent months have seen similar incidents, including a crash in Delta state that killed five. Rising fuel prices, over 400% in 18 months due to economic policies by President Bola Tinubu, have driven many into poverty.",
