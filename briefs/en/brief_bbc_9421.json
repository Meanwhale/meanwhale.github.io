    "news_text": "Starting Wednesday, North Korea will permanently block road and railway access to South Korea, aiming to completely separate the two nations. The Korean People's Army (KPA) claims this action is a self-defensive measure against South Korean military exercises and the presence of American nuclear assets. This decision escalates existing tensions, with North Korea's military stating that it is necessary to protect national security. The move is largely symbolic, as these routes have seen little use and have been dismantled over the past year. Additionally, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has indicated a shift away from pursuing reunification with the South. Despite expectations of constitutional amendments regarding unification, no changes were announced after a recent Supreme People's Assembly session. Analysts suggest North Korea may be waiting for the outcome of the upcoming US elections before making further decisions.",
