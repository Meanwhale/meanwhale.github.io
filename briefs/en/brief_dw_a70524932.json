Despite the tensions, experts believe India's relations with the US and UK will remain strong.",
    "news_text": "This week, the US and UK urged India to assist Canada in its investigation into the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist, allegedly linked to Indian agents. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau emphasized that India violated Canada's sovereignty, while India dismissed the allegations as absurd. The diplomatic fallout led to both countries expelling each other's diplomats. The US called for India to take the allegations seriously, and the UK expressed confidence in Canada's judicial system. However, Indian officials believe this incident will not significantly affect its relations with the US or UK, which have been strengthening in recent years. Experts noted that India's ties with the Five Eyes alliance remain robust, and the current tensions are unlikely to lead to geopolitical realignments.",
