    "news_text": "President William Ruto of Kenya has nominated Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki as his new deputy following the impeachment of Rigathi Gachagua, Ruto's previous deputy. The nomination was confirmed by Speaker Moses Wetang'ula in parliament, but a Kenyan court has temporarily halted Kindiki's appointment and the Senate's decision on Gachagua's impeachment until October 24. Kindiki, a close ally of Ruto, has faced criticism for alleged police brutality during recent protests. Gachagua, who denies the impeachment charges, is the first deputy president to be impeached under Kenya's revised 2010 constitution.",
