    "news_text": "The text discusses the economic landscape of the United States from 2009 to 2024, covering the presidencies of Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden. It highlights two major economic disruptions: the financial crisis that began in 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Despite these challenges, the U.S. economy has shown resilience, with GDP per capita growing annually except for 2009, and a current GDP of $27.36 trillion. Unemployment rose initially during Obama's term but has since stabilized around 4%. The text also notes increasing pay inequality, with the top 1% holding a significant portion of wealth, while the foreign-born population has grown substantially. Inflation has fluctuated, affecting consumer prices and voter sentiment, particularly as the election approaches.",
