    "news_text": "The U.S. presidential and national elections involve substantial resources, and the economic landscape from 2009 to 2024 reflects influences from global events and domestic policies. Key disruptions included the financial crisis preceding Obama's presidency and the COVID-19 pandemic during Trump's term. Despite challenges, such as rising unemployment and inflation, the U.S. economy has shown resilience, with GDP per capita growing annually since 2009, though income inequality remains a concern. The foreign-born population has significantly increased, and inflation has fluctuated, impacting living costs and voter sentiment ahead of elections.",
