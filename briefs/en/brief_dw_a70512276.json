    "news_text": "The period from 2009 to 2024, covering the presidencies of Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden, has seen the U.S. economy impacted by global events and domestic policies. Major disruptions included the financial crisis that began before Obama's term and the COVID-19 pandemic during Trump's presidency. While the economy has shown resilience, with GDP per capita growth and a strong recovery post-pandemic, challenges like unemployment fluctuations, pay inequality, and inflation persist. The U.S. remains the largest economy globally, but faces competition from countries like China and India. Additionally, the foreign-born population has significantly increased, and inflation has fluctuated dramatically, affecting living costs and voter sentiment.",
