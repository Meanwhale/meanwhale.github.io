    "news_text": "In Shanghai, a significant police response has disrupted Halloween festivities, with reports of officers dispersing costumed crowds and making arrests. Although no official ban on Halloween was announced, rumors of a crackdown circulated earlier in the month, coinciding with last year's viral Halloween event where costumes mocked the Chinese government. Eyewitness accounts describe police asking costumed individuals to leave and removing their disguises. Some businesses received government notices discouraging Halloween events, and universities warned students against participating in gatherings. This crackdown follows the White Paper Protest movement, highlighting ongoing tensions regarding freedom of expression in China.",
