    "news_original_title": "Trump admin paves way for mass deportation of Venezuelans",
    "news_text": "US President Donald Trump's administration, led by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, has revoked a decision that protected around 600,000 Venezuelans from deportation. This decision reverses an extension ordered by Joe Biden, which was set to last until October 2026. Noem stated that she is collaborating with Secretary of State Marco Rubio to explore deportation options, including the possibility of sending migrants to the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay. The Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program, which Biden expanded to cover over 1 million people from 17 countries, was initially aimed at providing relief to those from countries facing severe crises. Trump's administration had previously attempted to block TPS during his first term, and he has promised to tighten immigration controls in his 2024 campaign.",
