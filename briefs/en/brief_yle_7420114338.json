    "news_text": "CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, marks its 70th anniversary, emphasizing the importance of particle research in today's world. Finnish researcher Jaana Heikkil\u00e4 highlights the need for CERN's work, especially as it ends collaboration with Russian institutions due to current geopolitical tensions. This decision affects around 500 researchers, although many Russian scientists remain at CERN. The organization is known for significant contributions to science, including the development of the World Wide Web and advancements in cancer research. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is crucial for exploring fundamental questions about the universe. Future plans include the construction of the Future Circular Collider (FCC) to further enhance research capabilities. CERN is a highly international center with 24 member states, including Finland since 1991, and aims to foster diversity in its research teams.",
