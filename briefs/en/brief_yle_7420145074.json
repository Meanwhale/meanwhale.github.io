    "news_text": "The Supreme Administrative Court of France has ordered the closure of the C8 television channel due to repeated violations of human rights and inadequate protection of minors. The channel, which is part of Canal +, will cease operations on March 1, as it did not secure a new license. C8 was fined \u20ac3.5 million in 2023 after a host insulted a left-wing politician. The decision has faced opposition from several right-wing politicians, including Marine Le Pen, who argue it infringes on freedom of expression. Approximately 400 employees may lose their jobs as a result of this closure, although a new channel is set to replace C8.",
