    "news_text": "Immigration has been a significant issue in the U.S. since the 19th century, with political rhetoric evolving over time. Key themes in presidential elections include abortion rights, which gained prominence after the Supreme Court's 1973 decision, and immigration policy, particularly concerning the southern border. Economic issues, influenced by inflation and tax policies, also play a crucial role, alongside foreign policy debates about isolationism versus participation. Environmental concerns have become increasingly marginalized in political discourse, contrasting with the U.S.'s historical leadership in environmental protection.",
