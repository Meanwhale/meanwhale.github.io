    "news_text": "Researchers from the University of Strathclyde, WWF, and the British Antarctic Survey are developing a method to monitor Antarctic krill populations using satellite technology. By analyzing how seawater absorbs light based on krill density, they aim to assess the impact of climate change and fishing on this vital species, which supports numerous marine animals. Conservationists stress the importance of protecting krill habitats and managing fisheries to maintain the health of the Southern Ocean.",
