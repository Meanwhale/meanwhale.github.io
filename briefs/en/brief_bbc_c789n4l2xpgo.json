    "news_text": "Interest rates are anticipated to be lowered by the Bank of England on Thursday, with analysts predicting a drop from 5% to 4.75%. This reduction would make borrowing cheaper but could decrease returns for savers. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee meets regularly to set rates, and the decision comes after a recent drop in UK inflation to 1.7%. Political events, including the recent Budget and Donald Trump's presidential win, may influence the Bank's decision. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve will also announce its interest rate decision later the same day.",
