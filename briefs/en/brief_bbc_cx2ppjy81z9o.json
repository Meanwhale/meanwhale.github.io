    "news_header": "UK shop sales fell unexpectedly before Christmas, driven by poor food sales, raising concerns about the economy.",
    "news_text": "Shop sales in the UK unexpectedly fell by 0.3% in December, primarily due to a significant decline in food sales at supermarkets, marking the lowest level in over a decade. Despite this, clothing and department stores experienced increased sales. The disappointing retail data follows sluggish economic growth, although the IMF has upgraded its growth forecast for the UK. The pound initially dropped but recovered, and expectations of an interest rate cut boosted share prices. The Chancellor faces pressure to stimulate growth, with suggestions to ease mortgage lending rules. Overall, the retail sector ended 2024 on a disappointing note, but some economists remain optimistic about future consumer spending.",
