    "news_header": "A survey shows that if Europeans could vote in the US presidential election, Kamala Harris would overwhelmingly win in Western Europe, while Donald Trump has some support in Eastern Europe. European leaders express concerns about Trump's potential victory and emphasize the need for strong ties with the US, regardless of the outcome.",
    "news_text": "A recent survey indicates that if Europeans were to vote in the upcoming US presidential election, Kamala Harris would receive 69% support in Western Europe, while Donald Trump would garner only 16%. In Eastern Europe, Harris would receive 46% support compared to Trump's 36%. European leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, express a preference for Harris, citing her predictability and commitment to trans-Atlantic cooperation. In contrast, some far-right politicians, like Hungary's Viktor Orban, support Trump, believing he could bring about significant changes in US politics and resolve conflicts. EU diplomats are preparing for both potential outcomes, aiming to protect European interests regardless of who wins.",
