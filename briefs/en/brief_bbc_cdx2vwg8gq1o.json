    "news_original_title": "India bans two opioids behind crisis in West Africa",
    "news_text": "In response to a BBC investigation, Indian authorities have banned the opioids tapentadol and carisoprodol, which were found to be contributing to a public health crisis in West Africa. The Drugs Controller General, Dr. Rajeev Singh Raghuvanshi, stated that the permission for manufacturing and exporting these drugs has been revoked. The investigation revealed that Aveo Pharmaceuticals was illegally exporting a dangerous combination of these opioids to countries like Ghana and Nigeria. Following a raid on their Mumbai factory, the entire stock was seized. The ban is effective immediately, citing concerns over drug abuse and its harmful effects. Despite their risks, these opioids are popular in West Africa due to their low cost and availability. The BBC&#x27;s investigation included undercover footage showing Aveo&#x27;s director acknowledging the harmful nature of the drugs while discussing their appeal to Nigerian teenagers. The Indian FDA is taking further legal action against Aveo and will conduct more inspections to prevent the drugs&#x27; supply.",
