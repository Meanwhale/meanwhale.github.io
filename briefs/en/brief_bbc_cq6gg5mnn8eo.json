    "news_original_title": "'Dark oxygen' mission takes aim at other worlds",
    "news_text": "Recent findings reveal that metal lumps on the dark seabed generate oxygen, challenging previous beliefs that only sunlight-driven photosynthesis could produce it. This discovery has sparked interest in exploring the deepest parts of Earth's oceans to understand this phenomenon, which may suggest that similar processes could occur on other planets, potentially supporting life. The lead researcher, Prof. Andrew Sweetman, is collaborating with NASA to investigate these findings further, amid criticism from some scientists and mining companies concerned about the implications for marine ecosystems and seabed mining activities. The research aims to clarify the role of these metal nodules in oxygen production and assess the environmental impact of potential mining operations.",
