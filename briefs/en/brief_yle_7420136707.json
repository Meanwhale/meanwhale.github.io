    "news_text": "Special Prosecutor Jack Smith reported that evidence was sufficient to convict Donald Trump for attempting to overturn the 2020 election results. However, Trump's success in the 2024 presidential election made it impossible to pursue the charges. The Justice Department believes the Constitution prevents prosecution of a sitting president, regardless of the severity of the alleged crimes. Charges against Trump were dropped in November, but they could be reinstated after his term ends. Trump has indicated he would dismiss Smith and close the proceedings against him if he returns to the White House.",
