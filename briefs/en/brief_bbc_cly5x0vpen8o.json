    "news_text": "President Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra of the Central African Republic has introduced a meme-coin called $CAR to enhance the country&#x27;s visibility, which is among the poorest globally. Meme-coins are known for their volatility and are often used to capitalize on internet trends. Despite an initial announcement of success, the coin&#x27;s value plummeted by up to 90%. In 2022, CAR adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, but that initiative has not succeeded as intended. Touad\u00e9ra described the meme-coin launch as an experiment to unite people and support national development, although concerns about potential scams have been raised. The president aims to use the funds to help rebuild a deteriorating school, but the country&#x27;s ongoing civil war complicates its economic situation.",
