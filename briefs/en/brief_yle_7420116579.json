    "news_text": "UPM's recent profit warning highlights a decline in pulp prices, which is causing concern among forestry companies. The warning indicates weakening market demand for UPM's products and challenges in the pulp market. As demand for printing papers decreases, more pulp is being categorized as market pulp. The price of long-fibre conifer pulp, crucial for Finland, reached record highs earlier this summer but has since fallen. Current prices are fluctuating significantly, influenced by international market conditions, particularly in China. Finnish forest companies, having invested heavily in pulp mills and biorefineries, may face significant earnings pressure in the upcoming quarter. Predictions suggest an increase in pulp production and exports next year, particularly from Mets\u00e4 Group's Kemi mill, with long-fibre pulp being ideal for packaging materials.",
