    "news_text": "The former President of Peru, Alejandro Toledo, was convicted of receiving $35 million in bribes from the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht and sentenced to 20.5 years in prison for corruption. The Supreme Court upheld the prosecutor's recommendation for the sentence. Toledo, who served as president from 2001 to 2006, was found guilty of conspiracy and money laundering after Odebrecht won a bid for a motorway project between Peru and Brazil. The company, now known as Novonor, has admitted to paying bribes across Latin America for public works contracts. Toledo, who lived in the U.S. before surrendering in May, has appealed for leniency due to health issues, expressing a desire to receive treatment at home. He is not the only former president implicated in the scandal; Alan Garcia committed suicide in 2019 when police attempted to arrest him, and Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned in 2018 amid allegations related to Odebrecht.",
