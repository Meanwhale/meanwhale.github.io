    "news_text": "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced that the single bus fare cap in England will rise to \u00a33 from the current \u00a32, which was set to expire at the end of December. This change aims to support the cost of living, especially in rural communities that heavily rely on bus services. The new cap will remain in place until the end of 2025, impacting approximately 3.4 million bus users. While the Confederation of Passenger Transport acknowledged that the increase avoids a sudden fare hike, concerns remain about affordability for passengers. Some individuals, like Lancaster University student Joshua Anderton, expressed frustration over the fare increase, citing financial strain. Greenpeace criticized the decision, arguing it undermines support for lower-income individuals who depend on bus services.",
