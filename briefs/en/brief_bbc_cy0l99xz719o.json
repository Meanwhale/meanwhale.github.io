    "news_text": "In the upcoming Budget, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has announced an increase in the bus fare cap in England from \u00a32 to \u00a33, effective until the end of 2025. This change aims to assist with the cost of living, especially in rural areas where bus services are vital. Approximately 3.4 million people rely on buses in England. The previous cap was set to expire at the end of December, and there were concerns that its removal could lead to significant fare increases. While the new cap avoids a sudden fare hike, challenges remain for passengers who depend on affordable bus travel. In contrast, bus fares in London and Greater Manchester will remain unchanged. Greenpeace criticized the decision, arguing that it undermines support for lower-income individuals who rely on bus services.",
