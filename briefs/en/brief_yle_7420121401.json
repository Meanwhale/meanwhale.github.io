    "news_text": "The UN Climate Conference will be held in Azerbaijan, but Papua New Guinea has announced a boycott of the COP29 climate summit scheduled for November. Foreign Minister Justin Tkatchenko described the conference as a waste of time, stating that the country will not participate until major polluters take meaningful action. He expressed frustration over the lack of progress in the past three years and emphasized that Papua New Guinea, home to one of the world's oldest rainforests, prefers bilateral negotiations for climate agreements over participating in the conference.",
