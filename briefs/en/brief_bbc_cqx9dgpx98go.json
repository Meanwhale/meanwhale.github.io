    "news_text": "The European Space Agency (ESA) is closely monitoring asteroid 2024 YR4, which has a 1.3% chance of impacting Earth on December 22, 2032. While the likelihood of a collision is low, astronomers emphasize the importance of tracking such threats. The asteroid, detected on December 27, 2024, is estimated to be between 40m and 90m wide and could cause significant damage if it were to hit a populated area. Currently rated as a level 3 threat on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, further observations may reduce the impact probability to zero, as has happened with past asteroids. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) and the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG) are coordinating efforts to monitor the situation and will provide recommendations to the UN if necessary.",
