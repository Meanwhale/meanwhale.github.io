Poland's Minister Donald Tusk has denied asylum rights for those coming from Belarus, citing the Finnish model, while facing a surge of illegal entries. Human rights organizations oppose these measures, arguing they violate international agreements. Italy's government plans to transfer asylum seekers to Albania, a model supported by EU leaders, while discussions around the controversial Rwanda model continue.
