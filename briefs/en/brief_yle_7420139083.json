    "news_header": "A proposal to amend the Constitution for a possible third presidential term for Donald Trump is being discussed in the House of Representatives.",
    "news_text": "Currently, a U.S. President can serve a maximum of two terms. Donald Trump's second term has just started, but discussions are underway in the House of Representatives about allowing him a third term. Republican Andy Ogles has proposed amending the 22nd amendment to enable this, arguing it would strengthen the country. Although the proposal is unlikely to pass, it indicates Trump's support among House Republicans. The 22nd amendment was established in 1951 to limit presidential terms after Franklin D. Roosevelt served four consecutive terms. Ogles suggests that a president could serve three non-consecutive terms.",
