    "news_text": "Lauri J\u00e4rvinen, a researcher at LUT, has discovered ways to improve the production of green hydrogen, potentially lowering its cost to EUR 3 per kilo in fully renewable energy plants. Currently, green hydrogen costs around \u20ac4-8 per kilo, while fossil hydrogen is cheaper at \u20ac1-2 per kilo. The research indicates that with advancements in electrolytic technology and cheaper renewable energy, green hydrogen could become more competitive. J\u00e4rvinen emphasizes the importance of collaboration with industry to implement these findings, which could facilitate a green transition and reduce emissions in sectors like transport and chemicals.",
