    "news_text": "A study published in Nature Medicine reveals that microplastics in the brain have increased by 50% over the last eight years, with dementia patients showing six times higher levels. Microplastics have been found in human blood, semen, breast milk, and other tissues. The study emphasizes the need to understand exposure routes and potential health effects, as microplastics are linked to strokes and heart attacks. The research indicates that while microplastics are prevalent, their exact impact on human health remains largely unknown.",
