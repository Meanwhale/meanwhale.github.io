    "news_text": "Alcon Entertainment, the production company behind Blade Runner 2049, has sued Tesla, Elon Musk, and Warner Bros Discovery, claiming they used imagery from the film without authorization at Tesla's robotaxi launch event. Alcon had previously denied a request from Warner Bros to use the film's material. The lawsuit alleges that AI was used to create promotional images based on the film despite the refusal. Alcon also accuses the event organizers of 'false endorsement' by implying a connection with Tesla. The lawsuit highlights the significant financial impact of the alleged misappropriation and mentions Musk's controversial behavior affecting potential partnerships. Additionally, the director of I, Robot has accused Musk of copying his designs for humanoid machines, leading to online skepticism about the originality of both films.",
