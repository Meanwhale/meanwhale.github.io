    "news_text": "At the Paris Motor Show, President Emmanuel Macron expressed concerns about the shrinking European market and strong competition from China, advocating for protective measures for domestic firms. The European Commission's decision to impose additional tariffs on Chinese electric cars has garnered mixed reactions within the EU, with Germany opposing the move. The situation has escalated into a trade conflict, with China retaliating by imposing tariffs on EU brandy and probing the EU's dairy sector. German carmakers, including BMW, oppose the tariffs, emphasizing the importance of free trade and cooperation with China. As geopolitical tensions rise, Chinese officials criticize the EU's actions as politically motivated and detrimental to globalization. Chinese companies are exploring options to maintain their presence in the European market amidst these challenges.",
