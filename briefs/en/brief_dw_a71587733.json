    "news_original_title": "African Union leadership: Who can best fix Africa&#x27;s problems?",
    "news_text": "Each candidate has a distinct vision for Africa&#x27;s future and claims relevant experience. Odinga, a prominent figure in Kenya, faces skepticism domestically despite his diplomatic background. Youssouf emphasizes security and regional integration but faces criticism over Djibouti&#x27;s human rights record. Randriamandrato, the youngest candidate, advocates for economic independence and development but lacks political clout. The AU must choose a leader capable of addressing Africa&#x27;s pressing challenges, including conflicts, economic instability, and climate change.",
