    "news_text": "In the morning, the bank's stock dropped nearly 8%. From July to September, it incurred high costs to address past issues, leading to a 22% rise in operating expenses. Earnings before taxes fell 34% year-on-year to EUR 27.6 million, with an equity ratio of 15.4%. The bank admitted to lending violations, resulting in tens of millions in credit loss reserves. A criminal investigation into stock market offenses began in May. Leadership changes included the departure of former CEO Pasi Helammi and the appointment of temporary CEO Sarianna Color, who emphasized significant investments in risk management. The bank plans to manage a EUR 240 million credit portfolio related to these violations and reported a financial asset loss of EUR 13.3 million. Despite these challenges, the bank remains confident in its financial position.",
