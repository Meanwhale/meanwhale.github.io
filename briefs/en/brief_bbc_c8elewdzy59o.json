    "news_text": "The CEO of Water UK has issued an apology for the industry's performance, which is under scrutiny due to rising bills, sewage spills, and insufficient investment. The government has initiated an Independent Water Commission, led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, to address these issues, potentially leading to the overhaul or elimination of the regulator Ofwat. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the need for a comprehensive review to reform the UK's water system, while ruling out nationalization due to costs. The review will consider various options, including higher bills for customers to attract private investment for necessary upgrades. The commission aims to gather input from diverse stakeholders, excluding water company staff, to ensure that reforms serve both customer and environmental interests. Public dissatisfaction is high, with calls for a national action plan to end pollution and enforce regulations, while some critics argue that the root issue lies in the privatization of the sector.",
