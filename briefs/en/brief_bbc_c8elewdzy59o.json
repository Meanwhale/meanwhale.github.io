    "news_text": "David Henderson, CEO of Water UK, has apologized for the industry's shortcomings as public discontent grows over rising water bills, sewage spills, and inadequate investment. The UK government has initiated a significant review, led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, to address these issues, potentially leading to reforms or the abolition of the regulator Ofwat. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the need for a comprehensive investigation into the failing water system, while ruling out nationalization due to costs. The review will consider various options, including increasing customer bills to attract private investment for necessary upgrades. Ofwat is preparing to allow higher bill increases, with proposed rises varying significantly among companies. The independent commission will gather input from diverse stakeholders to inform future legislation aimed at better serving customers and the environment.",
