    "news_text": "Fertility treatments are a rapidly growing market, estimated at $35 billion in 2023. Private clinics offer numerous additional treatments, often without sufficient research backing their effectiveness. Many patients, driven by desperation, may fall victim to misleading information and costly procedures that do not improve their chances of pregnancy. Tests like ERA and Be Ready, which claim to optimize embryo transfer timing, are widely marketed but lack substantial evidence of benefit and may even be harmful. While most patients seeking infertility treatment eventually have children, the commercialization of treatments raises concerns about unequal access and the proliferation of ineffective options.",
