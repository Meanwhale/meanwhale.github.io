    "news_text": "Former Chancellor Angela Merkel has reiterated her criticism of CDU leader Friedrich Merz for seeking votes from the far-right AfD to pass a non-binding resolution in parliament. She believes it is crucial not to remain silent in such situations and accused Merz of breaking his promise to avoid collaboration with the AfD. The move has sparked protests and criticism for violating a post-Nazi norm. Merz, the CDU's candidate for chancellor, rejected Merkel's criticism and blamed her migration policies for the rise of the AfD, which she disputes.",
