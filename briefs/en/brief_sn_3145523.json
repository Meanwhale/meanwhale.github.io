    "news_text": "In 'Uncovering Dinosaur Behavior,' David Hone critiques the tendency to make broad claims about dinosaur behavior based on limited fossil evidence. He discusses the significance of individual fossils and the biases in paleontological research that can skew our understanding. Hone argues that many behaviors are poorly represented in the fossil record, and he encourages a more cautious approach to interpreting ancient behaviors. The book highlights misconceptions, particularly regarding pack hunting in species like Deinonychus, and emphasizes the need for scientific rigor in paleontology.",
