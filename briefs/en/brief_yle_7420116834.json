    "news_text": "Nordea has been experiencing ongoing problems with its online banking services, leading to criticism for its lack of transparency and communication regarding these issues. The Finnish Parliament's Economic Committee has summoned representatives from Nordea and various government agencies for a hearing to discuss the implications of these service disruptions. While the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva) oversees banks and consumer protection, its response has been deemed insufficient by consumers, who feel that the responsibility for action rests too heavily on them. The media has taken a significant role in highlighting these banking issues, emphasizing the need for stronger regulatory responses to ensure consumer trust and service reliability.",
