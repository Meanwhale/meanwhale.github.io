    "news_text": "In a speech commemorating the 1956 Hungarian Uprising, Prime Minister Viktor Orban likened the European Union to the former Soviet Union, calling for Hungarians to resist Brussels as they did Moscow. He criticized the EU's support for Ukraine and claimed it was pushing Hungary towards war and unwanted immigration policies. Orban's comments come amid rising tensions with a new opposition party, led by Peter Magyar, which accuses him of corruption. The remarks by an advisor suggesting Hungary would not defend itself like Ukraine sparked outrage, revealing contradictions in Orban's stance on national sovereignty.",
