    "news_text": "Recent events on the Korean Peninsula have raised alarm, with both North and South Korea placing their militaries on heightened alert. Former South Korean politician Kim Sang-woo noted that while daily life in Seoul remains unchanged, the situation is precarious, with fears of accidental clashes escalating into major conflict. North Korea accused the South of drone incursions and responded with military meetings and threats, while the South prepared its defenses. Analysts highlight North Korea's internal economic struggles and its reliance on propaganda to maintain control, suggesting that the regime's aggressive posturing may be a tactic to rally support amid growing discontent. The alliance with Russia is seen as a temporary boost for North Korea, but questions remain about its long-term stability and military capabilities.",
