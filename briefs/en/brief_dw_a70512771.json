    "news_text": "Recent events on the Korean Peninsula have heightened regional tensions, with both North and South Korea increasing military readiness. North Korea accused the South of sending drones and propaganda leaflets, leading to retaliatory threats from both sides. Analysts note that while North Korea's regime is facing economic difficulties, it is using aggressive rhetoric to rally domestic support. The situation is complicated by North Korea's alliance with Russia, which some believe emboldens Pyongyang. Despite the heightened tensions, experts suggest that North Korea is unlikely to engage in a full-scale war due to its weakened conventional forces, although nuclear weapons remain a significant factor in the conflict.",
