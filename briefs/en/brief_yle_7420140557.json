    "news_text": "A recent Danish study led by Aarhus University reveals that women who have children while studying tend to earn higher salaries by the age of 40 than those who wait until after they start working. The study analyzed nearly 130,000 Danish women over 20 years and found that student mothers often develop better planning and organizational skills, which are valued by employers. However, women with higher university degrees who had children during their studies did not catch up in salary with those who had no children. The study also discusses Denmark&#x27;s initiatives to support fertility and family life, including free fertility treatments and financial incentives for families with children.",
