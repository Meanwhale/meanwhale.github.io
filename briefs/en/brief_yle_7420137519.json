    "news_text": "SpaceX launched its Starship rocket on its seventh test flight but lost contact with it eight minutes after launch. The company later confirmed that the Starship was destroyed. SpaceX engineer Kate Tice stated they lost the ship. The FAA reported that the destruction caused a temporary diversion of air traffic over the Gulf of Mexico. CEO Elon Musk commented on the failed test flight, emphasizing that while success was uncertain, entertainment was guaranteed. The Super Heavy Booster successfully returned to the launch platform shortly before the Starship lost contact. The test flight also aimed to simulate the deployment of Starlink satellites.",
