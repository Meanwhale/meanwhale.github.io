    "news_text": "Donald Trump's anticipated return to the White House is expected to hinder climate change initiatives significantly in the short term, particularly with the upcoming COP29 climate talks. Trump, a known climate skeptic, may prioritize fossil fuel expansion over renewable energy, despite growing public support for green energy. His potential withdrawal from the Paris Agreement could further complicate global climate efforts, as it would allow the U.S. to operate without UN oversight. Experts express concern that this could stall financial commitments from wealthier nations to developing countries, which are crucial for combating climate change. However, the long-term impact on sustainable energy growth remains uncertain, as some analysts believe the transition to green energy may continue despite Trump's policies.",
