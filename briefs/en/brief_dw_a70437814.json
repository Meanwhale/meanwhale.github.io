    "news_text": "The elections on Tuesday will see either Democratic candidate Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump vying for the presidency. The power they wield will depend on the outcomes in the US Congress, where all 435 House seats and 33 Senate seats are up for election. The House has been narrowly held by Republicans since 2022, while the Senate has staggered elections every two years. The Democrats face a challenging landscape, needing to defend 19 seats, while Republicans have fewer at stake. The polarized political environment may influence voting patterns, with potential vote splitting in key states. The outcome could impact the president's ability to appoint key positions and address pressing issues.",
