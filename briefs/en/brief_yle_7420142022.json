    "news_text": "The text examines the implications of Elon Musk&#x27;s influence on the U.S. Treasury and the DOGE Group&#x27;s involvement in federal financial transactions. Finnish experts, including Jani Wacker and Ville Soimets\u00e4, argue that Finland&#x27;s legal framework and strong principles of the rule of law prevent similar political maneuvers. They emphasize that the Finnish civil service is independent and protected from political interference, contrasting it with the current political climate in the U.S. where democracy is perceived to be under threat. Historical references are made to Finland&#x27;s past political challenges, highlighting the resilience of its democratic institutions.",
