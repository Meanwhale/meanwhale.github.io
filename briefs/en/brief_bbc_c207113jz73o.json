    "news_header": "Nearly 620 miles of new power lines are needed to meet the UK government's clean energy goals by 2030, requiring significant infrastructure development and investment.",
    "news_text": "A report from energy planners indicates that to achieve Labour's clean energy target of decarbonising electricity by 2030, approximately 620 miles (1,000 km) of new power lines and 4,800 km of undersea cables must be constructed. This ambitious plan necessitates a rapid increase in infrastructure development compared to the past decade. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has committed to reforming the planning system to expedite new connections. The report highlights the need for substantial investment, estimated at \u00a340 billion annually, primarily from the private sector, and suggests that wholesale energy prices may decrease as reliance on gas diminishes.",
