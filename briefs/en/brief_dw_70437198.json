    "news_text": "German Economy Minister Robert Habeck announced that the country's GDP is expected to shrink by 0.2% in 2014, indicating a continued recession. This downturn is attributed to both internal structural issues and external global challenges. The business climate index shows declining confidence among company managers, with many expressing dissatisfaction and pessimism about the future. The economic struggles have led to significant corporate changes, including the sale of Deutsche Bahn's logistics subsidiary and potential foreign takeovers of companies like Commerzbank. Economists suggest that the stagnation and structural changes in the economy naturally lead to such takeovers. The decline in foreign direct investment is seen as a sign of Germany's weaknesses as a business location. Experts argue that addressing bureaucracy and improving competitiveness are essential for economic recovery, while current government initiatives may not be sufficient to stimulate growth.",
