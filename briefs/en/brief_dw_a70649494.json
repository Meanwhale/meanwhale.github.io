    "news_text": "Germany's economy has faced years of sluggish growth and negative data, earning it the title of 'sick man of Europe.' However, recent data shows a 0.2% growth in the third quarter, avoiding a technical recession. Despite this, the economy shrank by 0.3% in the previous quarter, and inflation rose to 2.4%. Unemployment remained steady at 6%, with concerns about investment and bureaucracy. While some surveys indicate stabilization in business sentiment, many experts warn of ongoing structural issues and a lack of growth forecasted for the coming years. The government is under pressure to address these challenges.",
