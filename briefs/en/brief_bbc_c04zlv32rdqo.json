    "news_text": "Mali&#x27;s military government is investigating claims that soldiers executed at least 24 civilians in the north. The allegations come from the Azawad Liberation Front, a Tuareg rebel group, which accuses Malian forces and Wagner mercenaries of intercepting vehicles traveling to Algeria and killing those onboard, including women and children. Army chief Gen Oumar Diarra dismissed the claims as unfounded, suggesting they are propagated by terrorist networks. The Malian government has faced ongoing struggles against Tuareg rebels and jihadist groups linked to Al-Qaeda and ISIS. Following military coups in 2020 and 2021, the junta hired Russian mercenaries to bolster security. Both the military and Russian forces have faced accusations of human rights abuses, which they deny. Recently, Mali, along with Burkina Faso and Niger, withdrew from the Ecowas bloc after refusing to restore civilian rule, marking a significant setback for the organization. Additionally, Mali severed ties with France, which withdrew its troops in 2022 after a decade of fighting insurgents, and all UN peacekeepers left the country the following year.",
