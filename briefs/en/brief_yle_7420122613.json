    "news_header": "Tax data published by the administration does not reflect the true number of high earners in Finland, as many incomes are hidden from public records.",
    "news_text": "The tax information released by the tax administration does not encompass all income and tax details. For instance, it only reports the number of individuals earning over a million euros, which is significantly lower than the actual figure. Many millionaires and high earners have their incomes concealed due to various tax strategies, such as tax-free dividends and the use of holding companies. Consequently, the published data shows only taxable income, leading to a substantial underreporting of high earners in Finland.",
