    "news_text": "Berlin police reported that a 19-year-old Syrian refugee, motivated by antisemitic beliefs, stabbed a 30-year-old Spanish tourist at the Holocaust Memorial. The attack occurred on Friday evening, with the victim suffering serious injuries but now stable after being placed in an artificial coma. The suspect, who arrived in Germany in 2023 as an unaccompanied minor and was granted asylum, was not previously known to law enforcement. This incident comes amid rising antisemitic incidents in Berlin, particularly following the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. The stabbing occurred just days before elections focused on migration and security issues.",
