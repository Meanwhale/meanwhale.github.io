    "news_text": "The top prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC), Karim Khan, announced plans to seek arrest warrants for senior Taliban leaders, including Supreme Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and chief justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani, due to their roles in the persecution of women and girls in Afghanistan. The ICC is investigating crimes against humanity committed since August 2021, including murder, imprisonment, and torture. The Taliban's oppressive actions have led to significant restrictions on women's rights, including access to education and public spaces. The Taliban government has yet to respond to the ICC's statement.",
