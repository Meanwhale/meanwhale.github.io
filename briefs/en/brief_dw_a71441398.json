    "news_text": "US President Donald Trump has invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to visit on February 4, making him the first foreign leader to meet Trump since his inauguration. The visit comes during a ceasefire with Hamas, following the October 7 attacks that resulted in significant casualties. Trump has suggested that Egypt and Jordan should temporarily take in Palestinians from Gaza, a proposal met with swift rejection. Meanwhile, over 375,000 Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza, and a bill to sanction the International Criminal Court for its warrant against Netanyahu failed in Congress.",
