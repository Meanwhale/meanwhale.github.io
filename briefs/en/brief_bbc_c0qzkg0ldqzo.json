    "news_text": "The UK government has confirmed that there will be no apology for Britain's involvement in the transatlantic slave trade during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Samoa next week. A spokesperson from Downing Street stated that there are no plans for a symbolic apology, following last year's rejection of financial reparations. King Charles previously expressed sorrow over colonial wrongdoings but did not issue an apology, which would require government approval. The focus at the summit will be on current challenges faced by Commonwealth nations. While some Labour MPs have called for an official apology, the government's stance remains unchanged from the previous administration. The issue of reparations and apologies continues to divide public opinion, with discussions expected to arise among other countries at the summit.",
