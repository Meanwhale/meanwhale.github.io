According to Jukka Appelqvist, the chief economist of the Central Chamber of Commerce, the survey supports the interpretation that a recovery from the economic downturn has begun. 35% of responding companies reported an increase in revenue compared to the previous year, up from 29% in May. Expectations for future order volumes are also more optimistic. The survey, conducted at the end of September, included nearly 1,500 companies from various parts of Finland.",
