    "news_text": "Germany has extended border controls to all its borders, preventing 30,000 people from entering the country. Currently, eight EU countries are checking passports at internal borders, with Germany's measures being the most stringent. The reintroduction of internal border controls is aimed at preventing illegal entry and has been influenced by a recent incident involving a Syrian asylum seeker. While some travelers express understanding and support for the checks, concerns about the impact on freedom of movement within the Schengen area persist. The German government, under pressure to limit migration, has faced criticism for its approach, with discussions ongoing about the treatment of asylum seekers and the need for better control at external EU borders. The situation reflects a growing trend in Europe towards stricter border management amid rising anti-immigration sentiments.",
