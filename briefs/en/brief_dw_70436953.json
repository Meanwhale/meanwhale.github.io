    "news_text": "Ethiopia's former foreign minister, Taye Astke Selassie, has been approved as the new president, taking on a largely ceremonial role while Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed retains significant political power. Taye, 68, is a seasoned diplomat with extensive experience, including roles at the UN and as foreign minister. He plans to prioritize sustainable national peace, the rule of law, and economic growth, aiming for an 8.4% increase this year. Taye emphasized the government's readiness for dialogue amid ongoing internal conflicts and pledged to combat hate speech and actions threatening public unity. He also expressed intentions for greater international engagement, particularly in the Horn of Africa. Taye succeeds Sahle-Work Zewde, Ethiopia's first female president, who stepped down after a tumultuous period. Her tenure was marked by efforts to empower women and enhance Ethiopia's international image, but was overshadowed by internal conflicts during Abiy Ahmed's leadership.",
