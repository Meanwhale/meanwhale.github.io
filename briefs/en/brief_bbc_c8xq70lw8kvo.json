    "news_text": "Neha Satpute and Akshay Pise, Indian engineers on H-1B visas, are expecting their first child in the US but are concerned about their child&#x27;s citizenship due to President Trump&#x27;s proposed rule that would deny automatic US citizenship to children born to temporary foreign workers. A federal judge has temporarily blocked this order, but uncertainty remains as they await the birth of their son. They are focused on a safe delivery while grappling with the implications of their child&#x27;s nationality, as many Indian families in the US share similar concerns about the potential impact of this policy on their future.",
