    "news_text": "Recent plunging temperatures and the cessation of Russian gas deliveries via Ukraine have led to concerningly low gas inventories in the UK, with storage reported at 42% capacity. Centrica noted that UK gas stocks were 26% lower than the same period last year, leaving less than a week of stored gas for heating. In contrast, Germany and Poland have significantly higher storage levels. The UK has less gas storage capacity compared to other European countries and relies heavily on imports. The government is urged to invest in gas storage facilities to ensure a stable supply amid rising energy prices.",
