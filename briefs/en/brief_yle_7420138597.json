    "news_text": "The United States is capable of producing record amounts of oil and gas, but it faces challenges in finding buyers, particularly in Europe. The slogan 'Drill baby drill' has been associated with former President Trump, who pushed for increased production and threatened tariffs on European imports. While LNG imports from the U.S. to the EU have surged due to the need to replace Russian gas, overall fossil fuel demand in Europe has been declining for two decades. Experts suggest that while the U.S. can compete in the market, long-term demand may not be sufficient, especially as countries like Germany seek cheaper alternatives and as global fossil fuel consumption growth slows. The transition to renewable energy is also a priority for many nations, complicating the outlook for U.S. fossil fuel exports.",
