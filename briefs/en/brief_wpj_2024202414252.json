    "news_header": "Monaco's property market is experiencing increased demand due to a rise in ultra-high-net-worth individuals, with significant new developments underway to address housing shortages.",
    "news_text": "Monaco, a small yet affluent principality with a diverse population, is projected to see a 23% increase in ultra-high-net-worth individuals over the next five years, alongside a 43% rise in dollar millionaires. With only 21,123 dwellings, 81% of which are privately owned, the housing market is under pressure. Two major projects, Bay House and Mareterra, are set to provide new residential options, although many units are already sold. The housing challenges also affect Monegasques, prompting Prince Albert to initiate a 15-year plan to increase state-owned apartments. The allure of Monaco is growing due to rising taxes and geopolitical tensions elsewhere, making it an attractive relocation destination for high-net-worth individuals. Despite a decline in resale transactions in 2023, property prices have remained resilient, with a 1% overall increase in 2024.",
