    "news_text": "The governments of India and China have reached an agreement on a patrolling arrangement in the disputed Himalayan border area, as stated by Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri. This pact aims to facilitate disengagement and resolve tensions that arose from a deadly confrontation in 2020. Recent diplomatic and military talks have led to a consensus on these arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Misri did not elaborate on the specifics of the patrolling arrangements. The announcement comes ahead of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Russia for the BRICS summit, where he may meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Despite previous clashes that resulted in casualties on both sides, troops have been following protocols to avoid firearm use along the LAC, which separates Indian and Chinese territories.",
