    "news_text": "Hamas announced a delay in releasing hostages, calling it a &#x27;warning&#x27; to Israel and giving mediators time to pressure Israel to fulfill its obligations. The group lists complaints about humanitarian issues and the return of displaced people, while Israeli reluctance to provide temporary housing raises fears of Palestinian expulsion. Trump&#x27;s controversial comments about Palestinians leaving Gaza add to the tension, leading Hamas to question the purpose of ongoing ceasefire talks.
