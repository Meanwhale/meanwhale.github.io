    "news_text": "A Peruvian court has sentenced ex-President Alejandro Toledo to 20 years and six months in prison for corruption and money laundering, linked to $35 million in bribes from the Brazilian company Odebrecht. Toledo, who served from 2001 to 2006, was arrested in California five years ago and extradited to Peru last year. Judge In\u00e9s Rojas criticized Toledo for betraying public trust, while Toledo has denied the charges and reacted dismissively during the proceedings. The Odebrecht scandal has implicated several former Peruvian presidents, including Alan Garc\u00eda, who died by suicide amid similar allegations.",
