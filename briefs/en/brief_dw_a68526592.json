The US Constitution sets basic eligibility requirements for presidential candidates, allowing many individuals, including those with criminal records, to run. The election process includes state-level primaries and caucuses to determine party support, followed by national conventions to officially nominate candidates. The election outcome is decided by the Electoral College, requiring a majority of 270 out of 538 electoral votes to win.",
