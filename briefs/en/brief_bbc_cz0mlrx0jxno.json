    "news_text": "Julie Bolthouse, an environmental campaigner, highlights that Northern Virginia has the highest concentration of data centres globally, which she believes is detrimental to the environment and local communities. With over 477 data centres, the region is a hub for internet traffic, largely due to its proximity to Washington DC and affordable electricity. The demand for data centres is surging, particularly due to AI advancements. Bolthouse and other activists oppose further expansion, citing issues like increased electricity demand, water usage, and air quality concerns. Similar movements are emerging worldwide, urging for more sustainable practices in the data centre industry.",
