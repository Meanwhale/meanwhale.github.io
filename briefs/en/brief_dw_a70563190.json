    "news_text": "Hurricane Oscar made landfall in Cuba, leading to severe damage, particularly in the eastern province of Guantanamo, and resulting in at least six fatalities, according to President Miguel Diaz-Canel. The storm caused a massive power outage after the collapse of Cuba's largest power plant, leaving the entire country in darkness and prompting small protests. While electricity was restored to most of Havana by Monday afternoon, many outside the capital remained without power. The Energy Minister noted that the hurricane impacted a key electricity production region, complicating recovery efforts. The Cuban government attributes its economic struggles to a US-imposed trade embargo, while the US blames Cuba's economic mismanagement.",
