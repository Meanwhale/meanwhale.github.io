    "news_text": "The Mozambican National Electoral Commission (CNE) declared Daniel Chapo, from the ruling Frelimo party, the winner of the presidential election, securing 70.67% of the votes. His main opponent, independent candidate Venancio Mondlane, received 20.32%, while Renamo's Ossufo Momade came third with 5.81%. Chapo, at 47, will be Mozambique's first president born after independence from Portugal. The elections, held on October 9, also included parliamentary and provincial governor positions. Despite Frelimo's expected victory, opposition parties have raised concerns about voter manipulation and electoral fraud, with reports of election observers being hindered and results being altered. Frelimo has been in power since 1975, and incumbent President Filipe Nyusi is stepping down after serving two terms.",
