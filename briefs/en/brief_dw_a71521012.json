    "news_text": "India's opposition has condemned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government for the alleged mistreatment of Indian immigrants deported by the US. A US military plane carrying 104 Indian migrants landed in Punjab, with reports of migrants being shackled during their deportation. Opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, protested outside parliament, demanding accountability from the Modi government. The issue arises just before Modi's visit to the US, where migration discussions are expected. India's External Affairs Minister stated that while restraints are standard during deportations, efforts are being made to ensure deportees are treated humanely.",
