    "news_text": "Elisah van den Bergh, the curator of the exhibition at the LAM museum in Lisse, Netherlands, discovered that a significant artwork by French artist Alexandre Lavet, titled 'All The Good Times We Spent Together', had been accidentally discarded by a new mechanic. The piece, which resembles two beer cans, was mistaken for trash but was actually a carefully painted artwork. The museum is known for placing art in unexpected locations, and this piece was positioned on the concrete floor against a wall, giving the impression it was left over from a celebration. After its recovery, the artwork has now been placed on a pedestal. This incident highlights the occasional mishaps that occur in museums, similar to a previous incident where a student ate a banana from a wall, which turned out to be part of a high-value artwork.",
