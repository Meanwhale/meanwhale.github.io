    "news_text": "The Russian Union of Crop Farmers estimates that poor weather, government seed shortages, and difficulties in obtaining tools have led to a significant reduction in cereal exports, forecasting a drop from 72 million tonnes last year to between 48 and 49 million tonnes this year. Russia, historically the largest exporter of cereals, has seen its revenue from exports decrease by 42% monthly, with a total of approximately EUR 15 billion in 2023. The cereal harvest fell to 125 million tonnes, a 14% decrease from the previous year, and 10 million tonnes of wheat were contaminated due to inadequate storage. Sanctions have further complicated farming operations.",
