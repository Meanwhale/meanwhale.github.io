    "news_text": "The term &#x27;the ick&#x27; describes a sudden feeling of revulsion towards a romantic partner, popularized by reality TV and social media. Researchers from Azusa Pacific University studied this phenomenon, analyzing TikTok videos to identify triggers such as gender incongruence, public embarrassment, and annoying speech. Their findings suggest that women are more likely to experience the ick in response to overt misogyny or physical quirks in men, while men are often repelled by women&#x27;s vanity or physical appearance. Additionally, individuals with higher levels of narcissism and perfectionism tend to experience the ick more frequently. The study highlights the need for further research on how the ick affects long-term relationships, as many individuals seem to hold unrealistic expectations of their partners.",
