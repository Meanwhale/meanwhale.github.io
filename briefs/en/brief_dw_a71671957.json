    "news_text": "The &#x27;ick&#x27; is a modern term for a sudden feeling of revulsion towards a romantic partner, popularized by reality TV and social media. Psychologists have studied its triggers, finding factors like gender incongruence, annoying speech, and physical quirks contribute to this feeling. Women are more likely to experience the &#x27;ick&#x27; in response to overt misogyny or physical appearance quirks. The study suggests that narcissism and perfectionism may heighten this response, reflecting modern dating challenges.",
