    "news_text": "Anurag Garg, founder of Everest PR, initially encouraged his team to adopt AI tools like ChatGPT to enhance productivity. However, the integration resulted in increased stress and longer task completion times due to the need for creating prompts and verifying outputs. Garg himself felt overwhelmed by the multitude of AI tools and their constant updates. After realizing the negative impact on employee morale and productivity, he scaled back the use of AI, allowing the team to focus on research instead. This shift led to improved job satisfaction. Surveys indicate a broader trend where many workers feel that AI tools increase their workload and contribute to burnout, highlighting the need for better support and training in adapting to new technologies.",
