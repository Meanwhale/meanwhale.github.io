    "news_text": "An expert suggests that the EU could potentially avoid customs duties by negotiating with the United States. President Trump announced new import duties of 25% on aluminum and steel, effective Monday, which primarily impact Canada, Mexico, and China. Finland&#x27;s direct steel and aluminum exports to the US are limited, amounting to around EUR 150-200 million, with the US accounting for just under 10% of Finland&#x27;s total exports. The Finnish steel company Outokumpu may benefit from these duties, but the overall impact on Finland&#x27;s economy remains uncertain. Trump&#x27;s suggestion to impose additional duties on the EU could affect economic growth, but negotiations may mitigate these duties as they did in the past.",
