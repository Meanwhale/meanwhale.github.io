    "news_text": "Over the past 30 years, megadroughts have become more common, hotter, and drier, leading to severe consequences such as water shortages, crop failures, and increased wildfires. The worst megadrought occurred in southwestern North America from 2008 to 2014, significantly affecting California. Grasslands are the most impacted ecosystems, but they show resilience compared to forests. The growing severity of these droughts may push ecosystems beyond their limits in the future.",
