    "news_text": "Recent experiments indicate that male mosquitoes, typically known for feeding on nectar, may also consume blood when humidity is low and sugar sources are scarce. This finding, reported by researchers from Penn State, suggests that male mosquitoes like Culex tarsalis and Aedes aegypti can feed on blood, albeit in limited circumstances. While male mosquitoes generally lack the ability to draw blood due to their mouthparts, dehydrated males have been observed to sip blood from wounds. Although the researchers doubt that males significantly contribute to disease transmission, this research prompts a reevaluation of the role of male mosquitoes in blood feeding and potential virus spread.",
