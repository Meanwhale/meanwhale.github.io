    "news_text": "Thomas Kwoyelo, a former commander of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), was sentenced to 40 years in prison by a Ugandan court for 44 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, and torture. The ruling, delivered by Judge Michael Elubu, highlighted the severe impact of Kwoyelo's actions on victims. Although he faced the possibility of the death penalty, his young recruitment into the LRA and expressed remorse led to a lesser sentence. Kwoyelo, who was abducted at age 12, is the first senior LRA member to be tried and sentenced, while the group's founder, Joseph Kony, remains at large. Kwoyelo has 14 days to appeal the conviction.",
