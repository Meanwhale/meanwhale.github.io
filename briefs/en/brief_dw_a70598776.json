    "news_text": "Thomas Kwoyelo, a former commander of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), was sentenced to 40 years in prison by a Ugandan court for 44 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, and torture. The ruling was made by Judge Michael Elubu at the International Crimes Division in Gulu. Kwoyelo, who was recruited by the LRA at a young age and expressed remorse, avoided the death penalty due to his background. He has the right to appeal within 14 days. His conviction marks a significant legal action against the LRA, whose founder, Joseph Kony, remains at large. The LRA's insurgency has resulted in an estimated 100,000 deaths and 60,000 child abductions since its inception in the 1980s.",
