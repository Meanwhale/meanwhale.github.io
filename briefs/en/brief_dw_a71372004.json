    "news_header": "A study of over 1.2 million medical records suggests that diabetes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy may reduce the risk of various health issues, including substance use disorders and mental health conditions.",
    "news_text": "Researchers found that GLP-1 receptor agonists, including Ozempic and Wegovy, not only aid in diabetes and weight management but may also lower the risk of alcohol, cannabis, and opioid use disorders, as well as reduce suicidal thoughts and psychiatric disorders. However, the study highlights potential side effects and emphasizes that these drugs require lifelong use and should not be seen as a quick fix. The findings are based on observational data from predominantly white male veterans, which limits generalizability.",
