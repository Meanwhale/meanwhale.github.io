    "news_text": "This year, numerous Finnish companies have transitioned back to in-office work, particularly in the autumn. Employees were informed that remote work would no longer follow the previous model, with an average expectation of three office days per week. This shift has caused concern among employees, especially after a decade of flexible remote work. Many employees feel that the new requirements are burdensome, and there is a significant disconnect between the desires of employees for more remote work and the expectations of business leaders. The University of Vaasa has also moved to a stricter in-office policy due to declining remote work practices. Overall, the landscape of remote work in Finland is evolving, with a push for more in-office presence despite employee preferences for flexibility.",
