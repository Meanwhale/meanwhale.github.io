    "news_text": "Two dark matter experiments have detected signs of neutrinos interacting with atomic nuclei, suggesting potential new interactions beyond gravity. Scientists are exploring the possibility of dark matter interacting via the weak nuclear force. Additionally, electrostatic charges in pollinators like moths and butterflies may attract microplastics, potentially disrupting pollination, though this remains untested. NASA's Perseverance rover has captured its first potential evidence of ancient life on Mars, with its self-portrait being a collaborative effort involving multiple images processed by engineers on Earth.",
