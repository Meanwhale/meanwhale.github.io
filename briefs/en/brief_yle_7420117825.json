    "news_text": "Finland's accession to NATO has opened various avenues for Finnish companies, particularly in the defense sector, but experts emphasize the need for government assistance to leverage these opportunities effectively. Industry leaders, such as Kim Westerlund from Nixu, highlight Finland's uncommercial approach to NATO, which could hinder its industries. While some companies have begun to engage directly with NATO, the process is complex and requires navigating procurement chains and security clearances. The demand for security certifications has surged since NATO membership, indicating growing interest in the defense market. Companies like Dispelix and Iceye see significant potential in defense contracts, but they stress the importance of state support and collaboration to optimize their roles within NATO. Overall, while NATO membership offers promising prospects, it also necessitates a strategic approach to ensure Finnish businesses can thrive in this new landscape.",
