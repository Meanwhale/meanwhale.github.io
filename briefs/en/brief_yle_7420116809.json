    "news_text": "Nordea's banking services have encountered ongoing problems for several weeks, leading to a decline in customer trust. The bank recently reported disruptions affecting its online and mobile banking services, including issues with account visibility and ATM withdrawals. These problems are attributed to internal software updates and have previously been exacerbated by denial-of-service attacks. The Finnish Parliament's Economic Committee will hold a hearing next week regarding these service interruptions. Yle is seeking individuals who are considering switching banks due to these issues.",
