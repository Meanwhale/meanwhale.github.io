    "news_text": "Oleg Stavitsky, CEO of the AI music app Endel, expresses concern that the EU's regulatory environment is hindering the growth of its AI sector, leading to a potential decline in competitiveness against US and Chinese firms. He argues that overregulation is driving startups out of Europe, as seen with companies like Apple and Meta delaying or withholding advanced AI features due to uncertainty over EU regulations. Industry leaders, including Cecilia Bonefeld-Dahl of DigitalEurope, highlight the rising compliance costs that are forcing many EU unicorns to relocate to the US. Despite some belief that US firms' reluctance to enter the EU market could benefit European startups, many dismiss this notion, citing the lack of funding and resources in Europe compared to the US. Calls for a new industrial strategy and increased investment in Europe have been made, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach to regulation that fosters innovation rather than stifling it.",
