    "news_text": "Lloyds Banking Group will close 136 branches by March next year, citing a shift to digital banking among customers. This includes 61 Lloyds, 61 Halifax, and 14 Bank of Scotland branches, with closures starting in May. The decision follows a significant decline in in-person transactions, which dropped by 48% over five years. The bank will offer jobs to affected employees and emphasizes that customers can still access banking services through various channels, including over 11,000 Post Office branches. Concerns about cash access for vulnerable individuals have been raised, prompting the government to support the establishment of banking hubs in 21 locations.",
