    "news_text": "The German Bundestag elections are crucial for the EU&#x27;s most powerful nation, deciding party leadership for the next four years. Key players include the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) led by Friedrich Merz, the right-wing AfD with Alice Weidel, the Social Democrats (SPD) with Olaf Scholz, and the Greens with Robert Habeck. A test is available to explore party positions on various themes, helping voters identify which party aligns with their views. Germany has a 5% threshold for parties to gain representation, making it essential for smaller parties to perform well.",
