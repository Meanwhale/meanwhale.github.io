    "news_text": "President Trump is threatening to withhold federal funds from states that allow transwomen to compete in girls&#x27; and women&#x27;s sports. This conflict escalated during an event at the White House, where Trump clashed with Maine Governor Janet Mills, who stated her state would not comply with his controversial regulation. Trump had signed this regulation earlier in February, aiming to restrict transgender participation in sports. Despite Trump&#x27;s threats, Governor Mills remained defiant, asserting her commitment to state and federal laws and indicating a willingness to challenge Trump in court. Trump expressed confidence in winning any legal battle and suggested that Mills&#x27; political career would suffer as a result of her stance.",
