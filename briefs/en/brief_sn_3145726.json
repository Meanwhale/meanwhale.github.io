    "news_header": "The theory of a midlife happiness crisis is being challenged by new research indicating varied happiness patterns across different age groups and cultures.",
    "news_text": "The long-held belief that happiness declines in midlife before rebounding is being questioned by recent studies. Researchers have found that happiness trajectories differ significantly across cultures, particularly in nonindustrialized regions. The U-curve model of happiness, which suggests a dip in midlife, is being criticized, with evidence showing that happiness may peak earlier or decline steadily after age 45. The focus is shifting towards understanding the mental health crisis among adolescents, suggesting that while midlife individuals may not be faring better, young people are facing increasing challenges.",
