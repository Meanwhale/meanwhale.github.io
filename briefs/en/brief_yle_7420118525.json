    "news_header": "Finland faces challenges in fulfilling its biodiversity commitments at a UN environmental meeting, with only 30 countries having completed their obligations.",
    "news_text": "Finland is among the 30 countries participating in a UN environmental initiative but has not submitted its national biodiversity strategies, which is a requirement for the meeting. The Finnish delegation, led by Minister of the Environment and Climate Kai Mykk\u00e4nen, acknowledges the importance of these strategies for international cooperation and biodiversity goals. The government aims to halt nature depletion by 2030 and achieve a positive natural heritage by 2035. However, the current strategy lacks quantitative goals, raising concerns among stakeholders. The meeting aims to finalize the Kunming-Montreal Biodiversity Framework, which seeks to protect 30% of the world's land and seas by 2030. Approximately 15,000 participants, including heads of state and various stakeholders, are expected to attend, emphasizing the urgency of addressing biodiversity loss.",
