The Finnish delegation, led by Minister Kai Mykk\u00e4nen, acknowledges the importance of these strategies, which are currently lacking. Despite setbacks, Finland aims to stop nature depletion by 2030 and achieve a nature-positive status by 2035. The recent Kunming-Montreal Biodiversity Framework aims to protect and restore significant portions of the world's ecosystems by 2030.
