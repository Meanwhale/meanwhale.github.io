    "news_header": "Finland is facing challenges in meeting biodiversity commitments at a UN environmental summit, with only a few countries having completed their national strategies.",
    "news_text": "Finland is among 30 countries that have not fully completed their biodiversity strategies for a United Nations environmental meeting. Despite this, Finland's chief negotiator, Marina von Weissenberg, expressed optimism, stating that while the absence of a report is not ideal, it is not catastrophic. The Finnish government aims to halt nature depletion by 2030 and achieve positive natural outcomes by 2035. The drafting of Finland's biodiversity strategy began in 2020 but has faced delays. The current government has excluded quantitative goals, which may undermine efforts. The meeting in Calin is significant, with around 15,000 participants expected, including heads of state and ministers from about 100 countries. The main focus will be on funding and sharing genetic sequence data, crucial for health and pharmaceuticals. The summit aims to establish a framework for future biodiversity actions.",
