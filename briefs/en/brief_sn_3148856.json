    "news_text": "President Trump has announced the U.S. intent to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO), citing financial burdens and dissatisfaction with its leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic. This withdrawal could significantly weaken WHO, as the U.S. is its largest donor, and may impact global health initiatives, particularly in poorer countries. Experts warn that this move could leave the U.S. isolated in addressing global health challenges and diminish its influence in international health policy.",
