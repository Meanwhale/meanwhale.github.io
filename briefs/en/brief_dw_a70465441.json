    "news_text": "A study utilizing the AI program LucaProt has identified more than 160,000 new RNA viruses, showcasing the extensive virosphere present in various ecosystems. The research involved analyzing over 10,000 metagenomic samples, leading to the discovery of 161,979 potential RNA virus species. Despite the significant findings, researchers believe this represents less than 0.1% of the total viruses that exist. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding viral diversity, although the newly discovered viruses are unlikely to pose threats to humans. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of emerging infectious diseases and the ecological roles of viruses.",
