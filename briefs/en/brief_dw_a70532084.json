    "news_text": "In Madhya Pradesh, India, minors, especially girls, are frequently targeted by sexual predators. The article recounts the traumatic experience of a 6-year-old girl named Masoom, who was raped in broad daylight, and the long-lasting effects on her and her family. Despite the rapist being sentenced to life in prison, such outcomes are rare, with many cases going unreported due to intimidation and a flawed justice system. The article also highlights the struggles of another victim, Chandralekha, a 14-year-old Dalit girl, whose family faces caste-based discrimination and threats while seeking justice. The systemic issues include police negligence and societal stigma against victims. Activists and local officials are working to challenge these toxic attitudes and raise awareness, but significant change remains a long-term goal.",
