    "news_text": "In a tragic incident in Washington, a military helicopter collided with an American Airlines passenger plane, leading to over 30 fatalities. The pilot of the helicopter may have been navigating visually, as suggested by Olli Jaarinen from the Finnish Air Federation Security Commission. The passenger plane was approaching Ronald Reagan National Airport when the crash occurred. Jaarinen noted that visual approaches are common in the U.S., but they can be risky, especially at low altitudes where collision warning systems are ineffective. The darkness and city lights may have impaired the helicopter crew's visibility, contributing to the accident.",
