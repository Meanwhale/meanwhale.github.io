    "news_text": "Research indicates that the core&#x27;s rotation has synchronized with the planet&#x27;s outer shell, and it may have been distorting at its edges. This understanding is crucial for scientific research, even though it does not affect daily life. The core&#x27;s eventual cooling and cessation of rotation could have significant implications for life on Earth.",
