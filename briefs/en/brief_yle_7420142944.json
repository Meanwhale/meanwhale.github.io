    "news_header": "Recent studies suggest that the Earth&#x27;s core has slowed its rotation and may have changed shape over the last 20 years. Scientists believe there is a solid metal core surrounded by a liquid layer, and seismic measurements indicate that the core&#x27;s edges may be uneven.",
    "news_original_title": "Tutkijoilta erikoinen havainto: Maan ydin on saattanut muuttaa muotoaan",
    "news_text": "The core&#x27;s rotation has been linked to the planet&#x27;s magnetic field, and changes in seismic waves could be due to the core&#x27;s shape or rotation. Despite these changes, they do not affect life on Earth&#x27;s surface. Understanding the core is crucial for scientific research, as it may eventually cool and stop spinning.",
