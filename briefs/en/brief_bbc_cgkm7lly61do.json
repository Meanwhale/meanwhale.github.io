    "news_original_title": "Invisible Losses: Tens of thousands fighting for Russia are dying unnoticed on the frontline in Ukraine",
    "news_text": "As the war in Ukraine enters its fourth year, over 95,000 Russian military personnel are estimated to have died, excluding militia losses from the self-proclaimed Donbas republics, which could add another 21,000 to 23,500 fatalities. The BBC, alongside independent media and volunteers, has been tracking these casualties since February 2022. The true death toll is likely much higher, with many soldiers unaccounted for. The conflict has disproportionately affected less privileged segments of Russian society, while the Kremlin has maintained a distance from the war&#x27;s impact on its elite. Additionally, convicts have been recruited to fight, with many casualties among them. Current estimates suggest that the actual number of Russian military deaths could range from 146,194 to 211,169, with total Russian-aligned fatalities potentially reaching up to 234,669. In contrast, Ukraine&#x27;s reported military deaths stand at around 43,000, with estimates suggesting this figure may be an undercount. As the war continues, attention is shifting towards potential peace negotiations.",
