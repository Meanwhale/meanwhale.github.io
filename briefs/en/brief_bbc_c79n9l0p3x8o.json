His protest echoed recent heckling by Indigenous Senator Lidia Thorpe, which has sparked mixed reactions among Aboriginal Australians. While some praised Thorpe's bravery, others criticized her actions as disrespectful. As crowds gathered to see the royals, many expressed excitement, with some participants in the protest feeling that their rights and issues were being overlooked. Meanwhile, King Charles engaged with Aboriginal elders and participated in community activities during his visit.",
