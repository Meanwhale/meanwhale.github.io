    "news_text": "A new class of antibodies has been identified to treat malaria, which remains a significant global health challenge, particularly in lower-income countries. The World Health Organization reported an increase in malaria cases in 2023. The study, published in Science, indicates that these antibodies could lead to next-generation antimalarial interventions. Current vaccines are not sufficiently effective, and new antibodies like MAD21-101 show promise without interfering with vaccine efficacy. However, further clinical testing is necessary to confirm their effectiveness in humans. The WHO aims to reduce malaria incidence by 90% by 2030, but challenges such as drug resistance and climate change hinder progress.",
