    "news_text": "The winner of Fat Bear Week has been announced as 128 Grazer, a mother bear who previously won the title last year. This year, she faced significant challenges, including the loss of one of her cubs to her competitor, 32 Chunk. The competition, held at Alaska's Katmai National Park, allows viewers to vote for their favorite bear after they have fattened up for winter. Grazer, who is 20 years old and raising her third litter, received over 71,000 votes, more than double that of Chunk. Her reputation as a highly defensive mother has earned her respect among other bears, elevating her rank in the bear hierarchy. The contest faced a delay this year due to a bear being killed on camera, but ultimately, 1.4 million votes were cast from over 100 countries.",
