    "news_text": "U.S. global health programs are in turmoil following a series of executive orders from the Trump administration, which paused foreign development assistance for 90 days. This has led to immediate disruptions in aid work, particularly affecting the PEPFAR program that provides HIV treatment to millions. The State Department issued a stop-work order, and healthcare workers were instructed to halt clinical services. Despite a significant budget for global health, experts warn that these actions could damage the U.S.'s credibility as a partner in international health efforts.",
