    "news_text": "Crude oil prices continued to decline on Thursday, dropping to a one-month low of $70.61 per barrel after a significant decrease the previous day. This decline was influenced by President Trump&#x27;s commitment to boost U.S. oil production and a stronger U.S. dollar. Additionally, a report indicated a sharp rise in U.S. crude oil inventories, which increased by 8.7 million barrels last week, surpassing economists&#x27; expectations.",
