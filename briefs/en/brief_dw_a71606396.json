    "news_text": "Since Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, its trade dynamics have drastically changed. In 2021, nearly 50% of Russian exports went to European countries, primarily energy products. By the end of 2023, China and India emerged as Russia&#x27;s main export markets, accounting for 32.7% and 16.8% of exports respectively. European nations now represent only about 15% of Russian exports, a significant decline. The shift is attributed to the EU&#x27;s reduction in Russian oil and gas imports, which have dropped by 90%. This has led to increased trade between Russia and nations that did not impose sanctions, particularly China and Turkey. China&#x27;s role has become crucial, providing 53% of Russia&#x27;s imports in 2023, up from 25.7% in 2021. While Russia is adapting to these changes, experts suggest it is not necessarily better off, as the quality of products has declined. The dependence on China raises concerns about Russia&#x27;s vulnerability in this new trade landscape.",
