    "news_text": "In the recent parliamentary elections in Lithuania, the establishment parties maintained their dominance, with the center-left Social Democrats (LSDP) winning 52 seats. The LSDP is expected to form a government with support from other parties. The populist Nemunas Dawn party, known for its anti-Israel stance, won at least 20 seats, allowing it to voice its criticisms from within the parliament. Despite some expected shifts in domestic policy towards a more left-wing approach, significant changes are not anticipated. Foreign policy will continue to focus on support for Ukraine and human rights, while relations with Russia and China may see some adjustments. The new government might seek to normalize ties with China without severing connections with Taiwan. The future dynamics within the Seimas will be closely watched, particularly regarding the actions of the Nemunas Dawn party.",
