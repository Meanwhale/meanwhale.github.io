    "news_text": "In Finland, a widow's pension is available to support financially after a spouse's death. The Finnish Centre for Pensions believes that this pension will remain intact despite reforms in the pension system. Survivor's pensions can be substantial, with no income ceiling, allowing for payouts that can reach tens of thousands of euros monthly. The system has been adjusted in recent years, and while discussions on pension reforms are ongoing, there is no immediate pressure to change the family pension system. Most recipients are low-income women, and the average widow's pension is significantly lower than the highest pensions. The pension system is financed through contributions from employees and employers, and reforms have been made to ensure its sustainability in light of demographic changes and economic factors.",
