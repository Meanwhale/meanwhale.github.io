    "news_header": "Two major lenders, Santander and Barclays, have launched mortgage deals with interest rates below 4%, driven by increased competition and expectations of further cuts by the Bank of England.",
    "news_original_title": "Some mortgage rates cut below 4% as competition picks up",
    "news_text": "However, these deals may not be accessible to all borrowers, particularly first-time buyers, and could come with high fees. Nationwide is also set to reduce some rates. The average rate for a two-year fixed mortgage is currently 5.48%. The Bank of England governor indicated potential further rate cuts, which could benefit borrowers but may negatively impact savers. The housing market is expected to see increased activity as mortgage rates potentially decline.",
