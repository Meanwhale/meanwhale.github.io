    "news_text": "YIT, Finland&#x27;s largest construction company, has nearly halved its inventory of finished apartments from over 1300 to around 700 due to accelerated buying decisions driven by price reductions and alternative benefits. CEO Heikki Vuorenmaa reported that nearly 600 apartments were sold in the past year, despite a focus on older dwellings in the housing market. Concerns from potential buyers about new apartments have prompted the sales team to address common questions. While investments in renewable energy and data centers are boosting the construction sector, YIT&#x27;s stock price fell over 15% due to last year&#x27;s losses and ongoing challenges in the housing market, leading to a decision not to pay dividends.",
