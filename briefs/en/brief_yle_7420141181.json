    "news_text": "Yle visited an area in India where activists fear speaking to the media about labor conditions. While some factory workers, particularly women, are experiencing better livelihoods, there are serious allegations of exploitation by companies. The report focuses on the Salcomp factory, which produces mobile phone chargers and employs a majority of female workers. One employee, N. Shanbagavalli, shares her positive experience and career advancement since joining the company. However, the report also highlights troubling practices at other factories, such as Foxconn, where workers face restrictions on their freedom and rights. The overall atmosphere in the region has become tense following labor disputes, and there are concerns about the treatment of workers and the recognition of their rights.",
