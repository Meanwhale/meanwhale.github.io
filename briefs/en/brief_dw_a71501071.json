    "news_text": "Scientists in the US are facing confusion and panic following a funding freeze on federal research by the Trump administration. Although the administration quickly reversed its decision to halt federal grants and loans, a review of federally-funded programs is ongoing. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), which funds over $40 billion annually in health research, has paused its funding, causing distress among researchers. Concerns about academic freedom and job security have led some scientists to consider opportunities abroad. Experts warn that the funding freeze could have long-term detrimental effects on US science, with many researchers uncertain about their future. The review process for NIH-funded programs raises further concerns about diversity and inclusion in research funding. The scientific community is looking to Michael Kratsios, Trump's nominee for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, for support.",
