    "news_text": "Recent statistics reveal that Europe has become the largest supporter of Ukraine, surpassing the United States. While Trump claims the US has provided over $300 billion in aid compared to Europe&#x27;s $100 billion, these assertions are misleading. The German Institute for the World Economy shows that Europe has contributed approximately \u20ac70 billion in humanitarian and financial aid and \u20ac62 billion in military support, totaling more than the US&#x27;s \u20ac50 billion in humanitarian aid and \u20ac64 billion in military assistance. Despite the US being the largest single donor, Europe&#x27;s overall support is greater. Economically, aid to Ukraine remains low relative to GDP in many European nations, with France contributing less than 0.2%. Experts emphasize the need for increased military support to effectively engage in peace negotiations, with calls for an additional $40 billion in military aid. The EU&#x27;s priority is to enhance support for Ukraine, as highlighted by officials.",
