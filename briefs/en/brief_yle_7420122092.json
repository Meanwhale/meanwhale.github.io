    "news_text": "A recent report by the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority reveals that the veterinary sector in Finland has experienced significant price increases due to market concentration, primarily controlled by two chains, Evidensia and Virea. Taru Turunen, a pet owner, highlights the high costs associated with her dog's medical care, which have doubled over the past decade. The report indicates that prices for veterinary services have risen by 28% from 2021 to 2024, significantly outpacing general consumer price increases. The concentration of the market, especially in urban areas, has led to reduced competition and higher costs for pet owners.",
