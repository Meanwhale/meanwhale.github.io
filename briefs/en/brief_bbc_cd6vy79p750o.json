    "news_text": "Commonwealth heads of government are preparing to address reparatory justice for the transatlantic slave trade at their upcoming summit in Samoa, despite the UK government's insistence that the issue is not on the agenda. Diplomatic sources indicate that discussions will focus on conducting research and fostering meaningful conversations about reparations, which could involve financial compensation and other forms of justice. The draft summit communique highlights the need for an inclusive dialogue on the historical impacts of slavery. Caribbean leaders have been vocal in their demands for reparations, with some estimates suggesting the UK owes over \u00a318 trillion. While UK officials aim to steer discussions towards current challenges like climate change, Caribbean nations remain committed to pursuing reparatory justice, with all candidates for the next Commonwealth secretary-general supporting this cause.",
