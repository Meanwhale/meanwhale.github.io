    "news_text": "The blockade starting next Monday will halt loading operations for companies like Machine and Helkama, as the ACP promotes collective bargaining amid ongoing industrial union strikes affecting nearly 50 companies and 13,100 employees. The blockade aims to prevent the movement of goods from these companies until a resolution is reached, as collective agreements for many workers are set to expire without a compromise in sight. The national mediator has indicated that proposals are futile due to the lack of potential for reconciliation.",
