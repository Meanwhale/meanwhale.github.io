    "news_text": "Romania&#x27;s President Klaus Iohannis has resigned just a day before facing an impeachment vote triggered by the controversial annulment of the presidential election last year. His decision to remain in office until a new election in May faced significant opposition, with critics labeling his actions as undemocratic. The constitutional court&#x27;s ruling to cancel the election led to public outcry, resulting in protests across the country. Iohannis cited national security concerns for his actions but ultimately stepped down to prevent further division. Ilie Bolojan will serve as interim president while the focus shifts to the upcoming election, where far-right candidate Calin Georgescu is favored.",
