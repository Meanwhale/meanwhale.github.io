    "news_text": "Wolfsburg, known as Volkswagen city, was established in 1938 to house workers for the VW factory, which produces the iconic Beetle. Currently, the city is experiencing anxiety as VW plans to close German plants and lay off thousands of workers due to an emerging crisis, despite reporting profits. The local economy, heavily reliant on VW, is showing signs of distress, with real estate agents noting a decline in home sales and consumer confidence. The once-bustling city center is now quiet, and businesses are struggling with reduced customer numbers. Tourists are also visiting less frequently, raising concerns about Wolfsburg's future as a car production hub.",
