    "news_text": "Hurricane Milton is moving towards the city of Tampa, Florida, and is expected to make landfall tonight or tomorrow morning according to Finnish time. The western coast of Florida saw heavy traffic as millions evacuated from the storm's path. Milton is predicted to bring strong winds, heavy rainfall, high waves, and flooding to the densely populated Tampa area. Evacuations have been ordered or recommended, especially for low-lying areas and near bodies of water, affecting 352 healthcare facilities, including 16 hospitals. Thousands of National Guard members are on standby for rescue and recovery efforts. Tornado warnings have been issued for 20 Florida counties, with the highest risk in central and southern Florida. Although Milton has weakened from a Category 5 to a Category 4 hurricane, it is still expected to cause significant damage in the Tampa area. FEMA representative Deanne Criswell stated that Florida may never have seen a storm like this, but emphasized that no one needs to die if they evacuate from danger zones.",
