    "news_text": "A geomagnetic storm that began recently in Finland is a result of a solar mass ejection. The storm reached its peak intensity last night, according to Petri Koskimaa from the Finnish Meteorological Institute, with the possibility of continued storms tonight. However, cloud cover in Finland may obstruct views of the auroras, although clearer skies in the west might offer some visibility. This storm is noted as the 16th strongest in 67 years, based on the DST index, which measures storm intensity. While this storm is significant, it is not the strongest of the year; a more intense storm occurred on Mother's Day. The current solar cycle, peaking in 2019 and expected to peak again in 2026, is conducive to such storms. High-energy protons from the solar event can affect satellites, potentially disrupting their electrical systems. Koskimaa notes that geomagnetic storms can increase atmospheric density, causing satellites to descend more rapidly.",
