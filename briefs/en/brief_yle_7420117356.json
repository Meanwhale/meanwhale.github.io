    "news_text": "A geomagnetic storm that began recently in Finland is a result of a solar mass ejection, with its strongest phase occurring last night. Although the storm is significant, cloud cover may hinder visibility of auroras, particularly in western Finland if conditions are clear. This storm ranks as the 16th strongest in 67 years, according to the DST index, but it is not the strongest of the year. Previous storms have caused issues with electricity grids and satellite operations, and the current solar cycle is expected to produce more such storms until 2026. The storm's high-energy protons can disrupt satellite equipment and affect their orbits.",
