    "news_text": "Airlines are set to incorporate synthetic aviation fuel, derived from CO2 emissions from factories, into their operations. By 2030, Norwegian airline Norwegian aims to use a fuel mix that includes carbon dioxide recovered from an Imatran factory. This synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) will be required to be mixed with renewable fuels, with a gradual increase in renewable fuel mandates leading to 70% by 2050. The production of synthetic fuels is gaining momentum in Europe, with over 40 projects underway, particularly in Norway, Sweden, France, and Germany. Companies like Norsk-e-Fuel are leading the way in production, while the aviation industry anticipates a slow transition towards low-carbon aviation due to current limitations in renewable fuel availability.",
