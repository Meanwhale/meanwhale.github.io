    "news_original_title": "Lidl lifts pay ahead of minimum wage rise",
    "news_text": "Lidl has announced a pay rise for approximately 28,000 employees, increasing its entry-level hourly wage from \u00a312.40 to \u00a312.75 ahead of the minimum wage hike in April. This move positions Lidl&#x27;s pay rates above those of competitors Sainsbury&#x27;s and Aldi. The statutory National Living Wage will rise from \u00a311.44 to \u00a312.21 for those aged 21 and over. Despite the pay increase, many retailers warn of potential job losses and store closures due to rising costs, including higher National Insurance Contributions. Sainsbury&#x27;s, for instance, is cutting 3,000 jobs while increasing wages. The economic climate is causing firms to hesitate in hiring new staff, with a significant drop in job vacancies.",
