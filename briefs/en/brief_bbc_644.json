    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves must find an additional \u00a316bn beyond the \u00a39bn tax increases in the Labour manifesto to meet the government's pre-election commitments without austerity, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). As she prepares for her first Budget announcement on 30 October, Reeves will need to navigate self-imposed restrictions on borrowing and spending amid rising public service demands and an aging population. The IFS warns that maintaining current public service levels requires real-term spending increases of about 2.8%. The government also aims to boost investment, but this may necessitate higher taxes due to the UK's elevated debt levels and current account deficit. Overall, the IFS emphasizes the need for tough decisions to avoid cuts in public services.",
