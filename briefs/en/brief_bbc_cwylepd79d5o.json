    "news_text": "Mandy Royle, a resident near the UK's largest waste incinerator in Runcorn, Cheshire, describes the horrendous living conditions caused by flies, rats, and pollution from the facility, which burns nearly a million tonnes of waste annually, much of it from distant areas. A BBC analysis reveals that deprived areas like Runcorn are disproportionately burdened with energy-from-waste incinerators. Many local families received a \u00a31m settlement for disturbances but had to sign non-disclosure agreements, limiting their ability to speak out. The Runcorn incinerator has breached air quality controls multiple times, contributing to environmental concerns. Waste is often transported long distances for incineration, increasing carbon emissions and local pollution. Residents express frustration over the lack of economic benefits and the mental toll of living near such facilities, questioning the fairness of waste management practices that target poorer communities.",
