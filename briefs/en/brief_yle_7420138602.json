    "news_text": "The government intends to combine four scientific panels\u2014climate, nature, sustainability, and forest bioeconomy\u2014into one entity and transfer them to the Treasury. This decision has drawn criticism from Heita Heiskanen, Secretary-General of the Climate Panel, who argues that the government has acted improperly and without proper consultation with the Ministry of the Environment. Heiskanen claims that changes to the panels would require legislative amendments, and he has been trying to engage with the preparatory officer regarding this issue. The Office of the Council of State states that the work is still in preliminary stages, and further involvement from the Ministry of the Environment is necessary. Prime Minister Petteri Orpo and Minister Sari Multala have not commented directly on the integration plans, while concerns have been raised about the qualifications of those conducting evaluations of the panels.",
