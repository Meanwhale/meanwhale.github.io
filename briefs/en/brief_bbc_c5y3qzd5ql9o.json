    "news_text": "LignoSat, the first wood-panelled satellite, has been launched by Japanese researchers to explore the feasibility of using timber as a renewable building material for future missions to the Moon and Mars. Weighing 900g, it will be sent to the International Space Station and then released into orbit. Made from magnolia wood without screws or glue, it aims to demonstrate that wood can be durable in space. The research team hopes that if trees can be grown on other planets, wood could be used for building colonies. While wood has been used in spacecraft before, its unpredictable properties pose engineering challenges. The project also raises questions about sustainability and space debris.",
