    "news_text": "On February 4, President Donald Trump made remarks about Gaza that emphasized its real estate potential rather than the humanitarian situation of its residents. He suggested that the U.S. could &#x27;take over&#x27; Gaza and turn it into a luxurious destination, echoing sentiments previously expressed by Jared Kushner. Trump&#x27;s comments have sparked outrage among Palestinians and raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest given his family&#x27;s business dealings in the Middle East, including partnerships with Saudi Arabian companies. Critics question the viability of Trump&#x27;s vision for Gaza, which he sees as an opportunity for development rather than a home for its current inhabitants.",
