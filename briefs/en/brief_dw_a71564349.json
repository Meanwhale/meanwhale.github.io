    "news_original_title": "Gaza: The Trump family&#x27;s Middle East business interests",
    "news_text": "On February 4, 2024, US President Donald Trump revived a controversial idea regarding Gaza, emphasizing its real estate potential rather than the humanitarian situation of its inhabitants. He suggested that the US could &#x27;take over&#x27; Gaza and transform it into a luxurious destination, echoing sentiments from his son-in-law Jared Kushner. Trump&#x27;s remarks have drawn criticism from Palestinians and global governments, raising concerns about conflicts of interest given his family&#x27;s business dealings in the Middle East, particularly with Saudi Arabia. The Trump Organization has been expanding its real estate interests in the region, including partnerships with Saudi companies. Both Trump and Kushner appear focused on developing Gaza as a real estate project rather than addressing the needs of its residents.",
