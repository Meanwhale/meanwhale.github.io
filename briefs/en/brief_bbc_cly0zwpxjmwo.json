    "news_text": "Moldova is actively working to attract foreign firms as it seeks to overcome political instability. Dutch entrepreneur Luc Vocks, who moved to Moldova in 2007, now runs DevelopmentAid, employing 180 people. The Moldovan government is encouraging foreign investment by offering a low corporate tax rate of 12%, and even lower at 7% for tech companies through the Moldova IT Park (MITP). This initiative aims to modernize the economy ahead of a potential EU membership by 2030. Despite challenges, including political tensions with Russia and ongoing emigration, Moldova is seen as a rapidly changing country with improving business conditions.",
