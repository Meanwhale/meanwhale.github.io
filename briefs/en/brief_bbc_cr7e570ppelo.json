    "news_text": "Nepal has seen a remarkable increase in its tiger population, tripling in a decade, which has led to concerns from Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli about the safety of humans. With nearly 40 fatalities from tiger attacks reported between 2019 and 2023, local communities believe the numbers are higher. Experts suggest that the government should focus on expanding protected areas and managing prey availability rather than capping tiger numbers. The rise in attacks indicates a need for a new conservation approach that considers the impact on local communities. Oli has proposed sending tigers abroad, while others argue for immediate action against problematic tigers. The situation remains unresolved, highlighting the challenges of coexistence between humans and wildlife in Nepal.",
