    "news_text": "For the first time, a fast radio burst (FRB) has been detected from an old, dead galaxy, challenging previous theories about their origins. The CHIME telescope in Canada identified 22 bursts from FRB 20240209A, which originated from the outskirts of a galaxy that is about 11 billion years old. This finding suggests that FRBs may be produced in ways not previously considered, possibly involving magnetars formed from old stars or other stellar remnants. The discovery raises questions about the mechanisms behind these energetic signals.",
