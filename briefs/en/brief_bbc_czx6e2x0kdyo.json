    "news_text": "Sellafield, located in Cumbria, is one of the world's most hazardous nuclear sites, housing the majority of the UK's radioactive waste and the largest stockpile of plutonium. The site operates 24/7 with a workforce of 11,000 and incurs over \u00a32 billion in annual costs. However, it faces security concerns, including a leaking storage silo and cyber-security issues. Experts emphasize the urgent need for a permanent solution to safely store nuclear waste, with plans for geological disposal facilities (GDF) being explored in various communities. While some communities express willingness to host a GDF, others resist due to safety concerns. The search for suitable geological sites continues, with the earliest potential waste disposal not expected until the 2050s, highlighting the ongoing challenges of managing nuclear waste in the UK.",
