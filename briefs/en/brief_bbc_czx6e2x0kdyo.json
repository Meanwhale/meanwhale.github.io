    "news_text": "Sellafield, located in Cumbria, is the UK's primary site for radioactive nuclear waste, housing a significant amount of plutonium and waste from nuclear power generation. The site operates continuously with a large workforce and substantial costs, but concerns have arisen regarding its security and the integrity of its aging storage facilities. A leaking silo from the 1960s highlights the need for modern solutions, as the site no longer produces nuclear material. The UK government is searching for a suitable location for a geological disposal facility (GDF) to safely store nuclear waste long-term, with several communities being considered. However, local opposition and the need for geological suitability complicate the process. The GDF aims to isolate waste from future populations, and while some international facilities are already operational, the UK\u2019s timeline for a GDF may extend into the 2050s. Experts emphasize the importance of addressing nuclear waste management as new nuclear power initiatives are considered.",
