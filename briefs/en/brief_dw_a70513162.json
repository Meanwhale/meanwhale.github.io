    "news_text": "A documentary aired on Spain's TVE suggests that Christopher Columbus was a Sephardic Jew from Western Europe, contradicting the long-held belief that he was from Genoa, Italy. This assertion comes from forensic researchers at the University of Granada, who claim to have found DNA evidence linking Columbus to Jewish ancestry. However, experts have expressed skepticism, noting that the findings have not been published in a scientific journal and lack verification. They argue that genetic analysis alone cannot determine a person's religion or nationality without historical context. The documentary claims that Columbus' remains are in Seville Cathedral and that his DNA shows connections to Western European populations, including traits consistent with Jewish origins. Critics emphasize the need for caution, as the research has not undergone peer review, and the evidence presented may not conclusively support the claims made about Columbus' identity.",
