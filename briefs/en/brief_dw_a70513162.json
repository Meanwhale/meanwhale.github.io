    "news_header": "A Spanish documentary claims Christopher Columbus was a Sephardic Jew, challenging his traditional identity as a Genovese Italian. However, experts question the validity of these claims due to lack of peer-reviewed evidence.",
    "news_text": "A documentary aired on Spain's TVE suggests that Christopher Columbus was a Sephardic Jew from Western Europe, contradicting the long-held belief that he was from Genoa, Italy. This assertion, made by forensic researchers from the University of Granada, claims that Columbus' DNA shows links to Jewish ancestry. However, experts have raised concerns about the credibility of these findings, noting that they have not been published in a scientific journal and lack the necessary historical context to determine Columbus' religion. Geneticists emphasize that DNA analysis alone cannot confirm nationality or religious identity, as these are social constructs not encoded in genetics. The researchers plan to present their findings at a press conference and submit them for peer review in the future.",
