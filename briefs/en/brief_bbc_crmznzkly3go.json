    "news_text": "Archaeologists have uncovered a large Maya city called Valeriana in Campeche, Mexico, using Lidar technology. This city, which may have housed 30,000 to 50,000 people at its peak, features pyramids, sports fields, and causeways. The discovery challenges the belief that tropical regions were devoid of complex civilizations. Climate change and Spanish conquests are believed to have contributed to the city's decline. The research highlights the potential for many more undiscovered sites in the region.",
