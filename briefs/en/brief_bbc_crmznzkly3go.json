    "news_text": "A significant Maya city, named Valeriana, has been uncovered in Campeche, Mexico, centuries after it vanished beneath jungle foliage. The discovery, made using Lidar technology, revealed pyramids, sports fields, and extensive infrastructure indicative of a large urban center that may have housed 30,000 to 50,000 people during its peak from 750 to 850 AD. The city, which spans approximately 16.6 sq km, features two major centers linked by causeways and includes plazas, temples, and evidence of a reservoir. This find challenges the belief that tropical regions were devoid of complex civilizations, suggesting instead that they were home to rich cultures. The research indicates that climate change, along with warfare and Spanish conquest, contributed to the decline of such cities. The study underscores the potential for many more undiscovered sites in the region, as Lidar technology has vastly improved archaeological surveying methods.",
