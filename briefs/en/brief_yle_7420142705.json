    "news_text": "The recent suspension of US foreign aid, initiated by President Trump, poses significant risks to both impoverished nations and American interests. Critics argue that cutting aid could weaken US soft power and allow countries like China and Russia to increase their influence in Africa. The aid has historically been a tool for promoting stability and development, and its withdrawal could lead to humanitarian crises, particularly in nations like Malawi, which relies heavily on US assistance. The situation raises concerns about the long-term implications for US foreign policy and global security.",
