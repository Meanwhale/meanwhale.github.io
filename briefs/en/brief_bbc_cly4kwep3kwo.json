    "news_text": "The UK government is proposing a new system that allows wind and solar farms ready for construction to bypass the existing queue for connections to the National Grid. Currently, projects are connected on a first-come-first-served basis, leading to long waiting times. The new plan aims to expedite connections for projects essential for achieving the UK\u2019s 2030 clean power goals. While some industry stakeholders view this as a positive development, there are concerns about potential legal challenges from projects that may be disadvantaged. The National Energy System Operator (NESO) is tasked with developing these plans, which require approval from the energy regulator Ofgem, with connections expected to start by the end of 2025. The current queue is significantly larger than needed, prompting calls for reform to remove stalled projects and enhance clarity for developers.",
