    "news_text": "Consti, under the leadership of Esa Suleela, announced its fourth quarter results, showing an operating profit of EUR 3.6 million, a decrease from EUR 3.9 million in the previous year. The operating profit margin fell to 3.9% from 4.5%. The order book decreased to EUR 240.1 million, with new orders totaling EUR 67.2 million. The company noted that the order intake was affected by tight competition and weak demand in the private real estate market. However, net sales rose to EUR 92.3 million, up from EUR 86.1 million, primarily due to growth in the Economics and Housing sectors. CEO Esa Suleela indicated that while the overall market for building construction is expected to contract in 2024, the company managed to maintain profitability and anticipates a stable operating result for 2025, with a dividend proposal of EUR 0.70 per share.",
