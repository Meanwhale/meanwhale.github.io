    "news_text": "Coca-Cola has announced a recall of various drinks, including Coca-Cola, Sprite, and Fanta, in northwestern Europe due to excessive chlorate content. This comes just as the company prepares to launch a new flavor, Coca-Cola Orange Cream, in the US. Chlorates, which can be byproducts of chlorine-based disinfectants, have been linked to potential health risks, particularly regarding iodine intake. The company claims that the risk to consumers is very low, but health authorities caution about chronic exposure effects, especially in vulnerable populations.",
