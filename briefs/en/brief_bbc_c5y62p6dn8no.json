    "news_text": "The statue of Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro has been reinstalled in Lima, Peru, more than 20 years after its removal. Unveiled during a ceremony for the city's 490th anniversary, the statue depicts Pizarro on horseback and was originally created in 1935. While supporters argue that Peru should acknowledge its history, indigenous leaders condemn Pizarro as a mass murderer who destroyed their culture. The statue was previously moved in 2003 due to damage from passing trains. The unveiling ceremony was attended by Lima's mayor and other dignitaries, but it also sparked protests from those opposing the statue's return.",
