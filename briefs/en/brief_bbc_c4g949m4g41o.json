    "news_text": "David, a 54-year-old man, was fined \u20ac200 at Nantes station in France for making a call on loudspeaker. Initially told he would be fined \u20ac150, the amount increased when he did not pay immediately. SNCF, the railway company, confirmed the fine and stated that their security staff are authorized to issue such penalties. Although there is no national law against loudspeaker use in public, noise regulations exist. Public opinion generally disapproves of loud phone conversations, leading to various policies in different countries regarding phone use on public transport.",
