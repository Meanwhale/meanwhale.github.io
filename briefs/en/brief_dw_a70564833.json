    "news_text": "Donald Trump recently stated that if he were still president, South Korea would be paying $10 billion a year for the US military presence in the country, a claim that alarmed South Korean officials. Currently, South Korea pays about $1.02 billion annually for the 28,500 US troops stationed there. Trump's comments have reignited fears that he may demand excessive payments if elected again, potentially straining the US-South Korea alliance. South Korean leaders worry that such demands could foster anti-American sentiment and weaken their position against North Korea. Polls indicate low support for Trump among South Koreans, and experts believe his statements may be aimed at a domestic audience. Despite concerns, some analysts remain hopeful that a potential Trump administration would prioritize maintaining alliances and strategic interests.",
