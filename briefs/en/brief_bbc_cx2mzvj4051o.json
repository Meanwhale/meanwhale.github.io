    "news_text": "Ursula von der Leyen, President of the EU Commission, suggested that the EU could learn from Italy's controversial policy of processing migrants offshore in Albania, ahead of an EU summit on migration. In a letter to member states, she highlighted the low return rate of irregular migrants in the EU, currently at about 20%. Italy has initiated a scheme to send some rescued migrants to Albania for processing, which has faced criticism from political opponents and NGOs for being costly and potentially harmful. Meanwhile, several EU countries are tightening their immigration policies in response to rising far-right sentiments, with Germany, France, and Poland implementing stricter measures. Last month, 15 member states supported a proposal to enhance the efficiency of deportations.",
