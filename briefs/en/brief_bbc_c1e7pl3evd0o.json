    "news_text": "A study examining blood samples from polar bears in the Chukchi Sea over three decades has found a significant increase in exposure to viruses, bacteria, and parasites. The research, conducted by scientists from the US Geological Survey, highlights that as the Arctic warms and sea ice diminishes, polar bears are encountering more pathogens typically associated with land animals. This change is concerning as it reflects broader shifts in the Arctic ecosystem. The study identified five pathogens that have become more prevalent, including those causing toxoplasmosis and brucellosis. While polar bears are generally resilient to disease, the findings underscore the impact of climate change on their health and habitat, as they increasingly rely on land for hunting due to the loss of sea ice.",
