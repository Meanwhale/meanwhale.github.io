    "news_text": "Research indicates that as the Arctic warms, polar bears are encountering more viruses, bacteria, and parasites than they did 30 years ago. A study analyzing blood samples from bears in the Chukchi Sea over three decades found increased chemical signals of infections from five pathogens, including two parasites and two bacteria. This change is attributed to significant sea ice loss and increased land use, affecting the bears' health and their prey. Although polar bears are generally robust against diseases, these findings highlight broader ecological changes in the Arctic. The study emphasizes that the loss of sea ice habitat poses the greatest threat to polar bears, impacting their ability to hunt and survive.",
