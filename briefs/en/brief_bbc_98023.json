This incident marks the first civilian deaths from Hezbollah since the recent escalation of conflict that began two weeks ago. The ongoing hostilities have led to daily rocket alerts in the area, with residents expressing anger and a desire for military action to stop the attacks. In response, Israel has intensified its military operations against Hezbollah, aiming to dismantle its infrastructure along the border. The conflict has also resulted in casualties on both sides, with reports of Israeli airstrikes causing deaths in Lebanon.",
