    "news_text": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet made a surprise appearance at a lookalike contest in Washington Square Park, NYC, attracting a large crowd of fans. He posed for photos with his doppelgangers while disguised in a mask and baseball hat. The event, organized by YouTuber Anthony Po, promised a $50 prize and had garnered thousands of RSVPs. Contestants were evaluated on their resemblance to Chalamet, with a focus on features like bone structure and French language skills. Miles Mitchell, dressed as Willy Wonka, won the contest but the event was deemed 'unscheduled' by police, leading to crowd dispersal and some attendees being taken into custody. Chalamet's appearance coincided with the upcoming release of his biopic about Bob Dylan, set for December in the US and January in the UK.",
