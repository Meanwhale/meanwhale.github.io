    "news_text": "Gerard Depardieu's trial on sexual assault charges commenced in Paris, but the actor was absent due to health concerns, as requested by his lawyer. Depardieu faces accusations from two women related to incidents during the filming of 'Les Volets Verts' in 2021, including making explicit remarks and groping. If found guilty, he could face five years in prison. The 75-year-old denies the allegations, claiming he has never abused a woman. The trial is significant for France's #MeToo movement, as Depardieu is a high-profile figure facing such accusations. His lawyer has alleged false accusations and suggested one woman aims to profit from the situation. Despite the allegations, Depardieu has received support from some in the artistic community, while French President Macron's comments in support of him have drawn criticism. The actor is also facing another trial next year for separate rape charges.",
