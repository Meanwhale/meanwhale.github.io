    "news_text": "The fossil energy sector, which has thrived for over a century, is facing a significant transition towards clean electricity, as highlighted by the International Energy Agency (IEA). This shift is expected to have profound implications for investors, particularly pension funds that have relied on dividends from oil companies. Experts like Kingsmill Bond warn against the risks of continued investment in fossil fuels, suggesting that many investors are unaware of the industry's declining growth. The 2015 Paris Agreement marked a turning point for Finnish pension companies, prompting them to reevaluate their investment strategies. While the fossil fuel industry remains large, its growth trajectory is crucial for investors to consider. The need for a gradual transition to renewable energy investments is emphasized, alongside the risks of greenwashing by companies claiming to support emissions reduction. Overall, the text underscores the urgency for investors to adapt to the changing energy landscape and the potential consequences of climate change on various sectors.",
