    "news_original_title": "Government finances in surplus but miss forecasts",
    "news_text": "The UK government reported a surplus of \u00a315.4 billion in January, the highest for that month in over 30 years, driven by increased tax receipts. However, this figure was below the Office for Budget Responsibility&#x27;s forecast of \u00a320.5 billion. This comes at a crucial time for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, as the economy faces sluggish growth and rising inflation, which may impact her tax and spending strategies. The OBR is set to release its latest economic outlook on March 26, which will clarify the fiscal space available to the Chancellor. Last October, they indicated she had \u00a39.9 billion in headroom, but current economic conditions may force her to consider tax increases or spending cuts.",
