    "news_text": "On Saturday, elections in Georgia could significantly impact the country's relationship with Europe and its potential EU membership, as it grapples with Russian influence. Senior OSCE advisor Smith noted that while many Georgians aspire to join the EU, the Russian government is pulling the country closer to its sphere of influence. Concerns are growing that Georgia could follow Belarus's path, particularly after the government passed a controversial 'law of foreign agents' limiting NGOs and freedom of expression. This law mirrors similar legislation in Russia and has stalled Georgia's EU aspirations. The potential victory of the Georgian Dream party may further align the country with Russia, deepening divisions within Europe, reminiscent of the Cold War. Smith and European Parliament member Haavisto suggest that clearer divisions may ultimately foster democratic progress.",
