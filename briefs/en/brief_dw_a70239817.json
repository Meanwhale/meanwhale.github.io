    "news_text": "Klaus Eberhardt, faced with his children\u2019s lack of interest in continuing his technology firm, iteratec, encouraged his employees to collectively buy the company instead of selling it to an investor. This cooperative ownership model reflects a broader issue in Germany, where nearly 70% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) struggle to find successors, particularly as many owners from the baby boomer generation retire. Young potential heirs often perceive taking over family businesses as burdensome due to concerns about competitiveness and the complexities of the business environment, including high taxes and bureaucratic challenges. Many young Germans prefer pursuing education and other careers over inheriting family businesses, leading to a significant gap in succession planning. Some, like Benny Hahn, are finding alternative paths to business ownership, while others express a desire for better guidance to make taking over a family business feel less risky.",
