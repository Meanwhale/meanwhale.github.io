    "news_text": "Klaus Eberhardt, founder of the Munich-based IT firm iteratec, opted for a collective buyout by his employees instead of selling to an investor, as his children showed no interest in taking over. This reflects a broader trend in Germany, where nearly 70% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) struggle with ownership succession. Many young potential heirs are deterred by the perceived risks and declining competitiveness of family businesses, leading to a demographic shift as older business owners retire. Factors such as high corporate taxes, rising energy costs, and bureaucratic obstacles further complicate the situation. While some young individuals, like Benny Hahn, are willing to take on leadership roles, many, including Carolin and Moritz, express reluctance due to a lack of interest or necessary skills. Improved guidance and support could encourage more young people to consider taking over family businesses.",
