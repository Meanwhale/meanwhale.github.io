    "news_text": "Stars in the Milky Way's thin disk have more planets than those in the thick disk. This is attributed to the chaotic conditions during the formation of thick disk stars, which occurred during a time of intense star formation known as cosmic noon. The radiation from newborn stars in this era likely destroyed protoplanetary disks, limiting planet formation. Consequently, thick disk stars have about half as many small planets compared to their thin disk counterparts. The findings suggest that the environment during star formation significantly impacts the eventual planetary systems.",
