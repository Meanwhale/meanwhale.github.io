    "news_text": "Since 1848, the U.S. media has been responsible for 'calling the race' in elections, providing unofficial results based on various data sources. This tradition began before modern technology, with the Associated Press leading the way in reporting results. While the media's role has evolved, it remains vital in offering quick estimations of election outcomes. However, discrepancies can arise, especially with varying state reporting times. The National Election Pool (NEP) and AP VoteCast are key players in this process, utilizing exit polls and voter data to project winners. Despite the reliance on data, human analysts ultimately decide when to declare a winner, aiming for high confidence levels. As a result, some races may remain undecided for days after election day.",
