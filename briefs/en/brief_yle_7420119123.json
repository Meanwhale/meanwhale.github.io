    "news_text": "The Energy Authority is involved in regulating electricity grid functions, particularly regarding charging stations for electric cars. In September, it instructed electricity grid operators to facilitate new connections for charging points, even if consumers already have subscriptions at the same address. The authority emphasizes the need for appropriate electrical installations and has identified issues with network operators blocking connections. Consumers may not always need a new connection and can acquire separate measurement points for charging. However, new regulations prevent the same electrical equipment from being part of multiple electricity contracts simultaneously. This aims to ensure fair pricing and clarity in the market, with companies like Caruna considering how to adapt to these changes.",
