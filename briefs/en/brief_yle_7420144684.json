    "news_text": "The rapid electric heating of cottages could lead to increased transfer fees during low power usage months. Many owners rely on quick heating, especially in winter, and electricity companies recommend installing three-phase sockets for efficient heating. However, proposed changes to the Electricity Market Act may introduce costly efficiency charges based on peak power usage, which could impact bills for up to a year. The Free-time Union opposes these charges, arguing that they unfairly penalize consumers who need to heat their cottages quickly. Alternatives like heat pumps and traditional heating methods exist but come with challenges. In Sweden, a mandatory power charge will be implemented by 2027, while Finland currently has voluntary measures. The Savon Voima Network suggests that future pricing could offer both charge and no-charge options. Accurate consumption data from new meters will aid in managing electricity usage effectively.",
