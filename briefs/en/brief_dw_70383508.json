    "news_text": "The potential strike by approximately 45,000 port workers along the eastern and Gulf coasts of the US poses a significant risk to global trade and supply chains, particularly impacting the delivery of perishable goods and the automotive industry. German car manufacturers, facing sluggish sales and a decline in exports to China, may be severely affected, especially since the US is their largest export market. However, experts suggest that if the strike is brief, German manufacturers may manage due to existing inventory levels. The dockworkers are demanding a 77% pay raise over six years and restrictions on automation. President Biden has the power to intervene, but has not yet indicated he will do so, despite the upcoming elections.",
