    "news_text": "Since the election of President Daniel Chapo in October, Mozambique has seen increasing unrest, particularly in the capital, Maputo, where opposition-led demonstrations are expected to escalate. Analysts warn of potential violence as the government attempts to suppress protests. The ruling party, FRELIMO, faces accusations of electoral fraud and a lack of engagement with the public's demands for change. The situation has led to heightened tensions, with police responding violently to protests, and opposition leader Ven\u00e2ncio Mondlane facing threats. Despite concerns for his safety, some believe his departure from Mozambique was a strategic decision. The protests mark a significant shift in public sentiment, with young people challenging the status quo and demanding accountability.",
