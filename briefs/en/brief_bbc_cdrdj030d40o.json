    "news_text": "Former President Barack Obama headlined a rally for Kamala Harris in Georgia, aiming to bolster support among black voters, a crucial demographic for Democrats. Despite a strong turnout of over 20,000 attendees, recent polling indicates Harris has lost some support compared to Joe Biden in 2020. Speakers, including Samuel L. Jackson and Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, criticized Donald Trump's past behavior to encourage voters to reject his candidacy. Obama addressed concerns about male voters being drawn to Trump's persona, asserting that true strength is not found in Trump's behavior. Harris closed the rally by emphasizing her commitment to protecting reproductive rights and economic plans for working Americans. The rally highlighted the significance of black voter turnout for Harris's presidential campaign.",
