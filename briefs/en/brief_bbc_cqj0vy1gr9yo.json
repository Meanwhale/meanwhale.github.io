    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has labeled the new budget as a 'Budget for growth', focusing on long-term infrastructure investment and reforms. However, the UK's independent forecaster predicts that the budget measures will not significantly boost the economy in the next three to five years. The budget includes a substantial increase in public spending and tax rises, particularly in National Insurance for employers, which may dampen disposable income and private investment. The chancellor aims to address the fiscal challenges inherited from the previous government, but the immediate and long-term growth prospects appear modest compared to the size of the budget. The budget is seen as a one-off response to specific issues rather than a sustainable economic strategy.",
