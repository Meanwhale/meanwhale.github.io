    "news_text": "The International Energy Agency (IEA) has released a report indicating a transformative change in the dynamics of economic growth and energy consumption. Historically, economic growth has been closely tied to increased energy consumption and emissions. However, the IEA forecasts that by 2035, economic growth will only require a 0.5% increase in energy consumption per year, a significant decrease from the previous decade's 1.4%. This shift is attributed to the rise of renewable energy sources, which generate no waste heat and require less energy for electricity production compared to fossil fuels. The report emphasizes that by 2030, the global economy can continue to grow without increasing reliance on oil, gas, or coal. Despite the rapid growth of renewable energy, particularly solar power, challenges remain, such as the need for improved electricity transmission infrastructure and competitiveness, especially in Europe compared to China, which leads in solar panel production. The IEA warns that while renewable energy production is expected to increase significantly, it may still fall short of the ambitious targets set at the Climate Change Conference.",
