    "news_text": "Government sources assert that extending the freeze on income tax thresholds beyond 2028 will not violate Labour's election pledge to not increase taxes on working people. Chancellor Rachel Reeves aims to raise \u00a340bn in the upcoming budget, with the threshold freeze potentially bringing an additional 400,000 people into the tax system. While the tax rates will remain unchanged, higher wages could lead to increased tax bills due to fiscal drag. Critics argue this move undermines Labour's promise, but the party has not pledged to reverse the previous government's freeze. Reeves faces a \u00a322bn gap in public finances and has warned of tough decisions ahead.",
