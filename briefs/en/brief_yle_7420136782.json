    "news_header": "Republicans are using California disaster relief as a political tool, seeking to impose conditions on aid related to the management of resources and policies of the Democratic governor.",
    "news_text": "The Republican Party aims to leverage California disaster relief in broader economic policy discussions. Congressional Republicans want to impose conditions on aid for victims of the California mountain fires, linking it to perceived mismanagement by Democratic leaders. Speaker Mike Johnson suggested that aid should have conditions, while Senator John Barrasso blamed the fires on 'liberal government politicians.' The financial damage from the fires is estimated between $50 and $150 billion. Despite previous support packages being approved without conditions, Republican representatives like Zach Nunn expect changes in behavior from California's Democratic leadership. Donald Trump has discussed using disaster relief as leverage for economic debates and plans to visit California soon.",
