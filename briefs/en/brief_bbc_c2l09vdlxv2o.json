    "news_text": "Dr. Chester Griffiths, a 62-year-old brain surgeon from Malibu, defied evacuation orders to combat the Palisades fire alongside his son and neighbor. Having anticipated a wildfire for years, he implemented an action plan with hoses to douse flames from rooftops. Despite battling the fire for nearly a week, they were only joined by firefighters later due to resource constraints. The Palisades Fire has devastated over 23,000 acres, resulting in at least 24 deaths and prompting urgent preparations for more potential destruction as winds are expected to intensify.",
