    "news_text": "As EU leaders prepare for a summit in Brussels, there is significant disagreement on migration and asylum policies. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is advocating for a unified European strategy and expedited reforms, while other nations push for measures like increased asylum hearings at external borders and quicker deportations. Some countries, including Hungary, the Netherlands, and Poland, are resisting EU policies, with Poland's Prime Minister seeking to suspend asylum laws. Meanwhile, nations like Italy and Finland are ignoring EU regulations, leading to border checks and unilateral actions. The European Commission is exploring cooperation with 'safe third countries' for processing asylum applications, but skepticism remains about the effectiveness of such models. Despite a decrease in arrivals in Italy, overall migration via other routes is rising, complicating the situation further.",
