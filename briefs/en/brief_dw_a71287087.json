    "news_text": "Over the weekend, suspected Islamist militants killed at least 40 farmers in Nigeria's Borno state. Governor Babanga Umara Zulum attributed the attack to Boko Haram or its breakaway faction, ISWAP. He called for an investigation and urged the armed forces to act against the perpetrators. Civilians were warned to remain in designated safe zones, as many farmers had ventured into areas known for insurgent activity. The ongoing violence has worsened food shortages in the region, which is already struggling due to previous flooding and displacement.",
