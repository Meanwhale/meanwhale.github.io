    "news_text": "Finnwatch's investigation into the climate efforts of Finnish fast food chains reveals significant disparities. Kotipizza ranks highest with clear emission reduction goals, while Subway's lack of transparency and action places it at the bottom. Other chains like Burger King, Hesburger, and McDonald's also show commitment to reducing climate impact. The report emphasizes the need for substantial reductions in meat consumption to achieve meaningful emissions cuts and highlights the role of consumer demand in promoting low-emission options.",
