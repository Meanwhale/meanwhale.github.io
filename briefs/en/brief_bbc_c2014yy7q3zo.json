    "news_text": "Residents in Godstone, Surrey, have been evacuated following the appearance of two sinkholes on the high street. The initial sinkhole, which appeared late Monday, has grown to at least 65 feet long. Experts suggest that a burst water main may have caused the sudden formation of these sinkholes, which are often linked to geological factors and human activities. Sinkholes can occur suddenly and pose risks, as seen in past incidents in the UK and worldwide.",
