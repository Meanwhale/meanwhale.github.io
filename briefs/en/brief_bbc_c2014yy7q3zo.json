    "news_text": "Residents in Godstone, Surrey, have been evacuated following the appearance of two sinkholes on the high street. The initial sinkhole, which first appeared late Monday, has grown to at least 65ft long by Tuesday. Sinkholes can occur due to geological factors, such as the dissolution of limestone, or human activities, like water main bursts. Experts suggest the recent sinkholes may be linked to historic mining in the area. The risks of sinkholes are heightened by extreme weather conditions.",
