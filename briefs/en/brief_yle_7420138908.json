    "news_text": "A major study found that in rural areas of the United States, where glyphosate use has increased, children, especially those from black and single-parent families, are over 60 times more likely to be underweight. Babies are born slightly earlier and with lower weights in these regions, leading to potential learning difficulties and increased healthcare costs exceeding $1 billion annually. The study analyzed data from over 10 million births between 1990 and 2013, noting a decline in birth weights coinciding with the introduction of genetically modified crops and glyphosate. The findings indicate that regulations on glyphosate use may be inadequate.",
