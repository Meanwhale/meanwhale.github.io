    "news_text": "Three Ghanaians recounted their involvement in the conflict between Islamist insurgents and the military in Burkina Faso, detailing scenes of violence and the deaths they witnessed. They crossed the border undetected to defend communities with familial ties, although one expressed religious zeal. Their accounts included the recruitment of Ghanaians by jihadist groups and the financial incentives from livestock theft. Despite Ghana remaining largely unaffected, there are concerns about the potential spread of violence and insurgency into the country, especially with ongoing ethnic conflicts in northern Ghana.",
