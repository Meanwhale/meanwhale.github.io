    "news_text": "A recent study using fMRI has found that depression changes internal brain communications, specifically expanding the salience network, which is crucial for motivation and attention. This alteration can be detected even before individuals exhibit symptoms of depression, allowing researchers to predict who may develop the condition. The study analyzed brain activity in 141 individuals with depression and 37 without, discovering that the salience network was enlarged in those with depression. This finding suggests that the salience network could serve as a potential biomarker for depression. However, some experts express skepticism about the possibility of identifying a single biomarker for such a complex condition, emphasizing that depressive symptoms may arise from various brain circuits interacting differently in individuals.",
