    "news_text": "Hurricane Milton struck Siesta Key, Florida, on Wednesday evening, bringing life-threatening storm surge, extreme winds, and flash flooding. Over two million homes and businesses lost power, with numerous homes destroyed and fatalities reported. The storm, which reached wind gusts of 90 mph, is impacting central Florida and moving towards Georgia and South Carolina. Officials declared a state of emergency and initiated evacuations along Florida's west coast. Milton, initially a category five hurricane, weakened to a category three upon landfall and was later downgraded to category one. The hurricane's rapid intensification is attributed to unusually warm Gulf waters, raising concerns about the effects of climate change on storm patterns.",
