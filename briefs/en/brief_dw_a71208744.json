    "news_text": "Norway has become a leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, with nearly 90% of cars sold in 2022 being electric, compared to a global rate of 18%. The country's commitment to combating climate change is supported by strong government policies, robust infrastructure, and public acceptance. Norway aims for all passenger cars sold to be zero-emission by the end of 2023, a decade ahead of the EU. Factors contributing to this success include Norway's wealth, a long-term commitment to EV development, favorable tax policies, and a green power grid. Despite rolling back some incentives, the country continues to support EV adoption, contrasting with other nations like Germany, which have cut subsidies.",
