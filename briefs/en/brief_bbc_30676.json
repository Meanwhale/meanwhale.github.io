    "news_text": "Rachel Reeves plans to alter borrowing rules to allow for billions more in spending on significant projects in the upcoming Budget. The Chancellor has committed to a self-imposed rule to reduce national debt as a percentage of the economy over five years. Reeves is considering changes to how debt is measured to facilitate long-term investments, although tax increases will still be necessary. The Treasury is assessing the financial implications of these changes with the Office for Budget Responsibility. Potential adjustments include factoring in the Bank of England's influence on national debt and possibly incorporating government assets into the debt measure. The Chancellor aims to reverse previous cuts to infrastructure spending, which is projected to decrease significantly by 2028-29. While the Opposition criticizes the government for manipulating rules, Cabinet members argue that previous fiscal rules hindered investment. The Treasury must communicate its Budget measures to the OBR this week to finalize the fiscal forecast by October 25.",
