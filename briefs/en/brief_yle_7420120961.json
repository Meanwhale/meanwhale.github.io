    "news_text": "Nokian Tyres opened a new tyre plant in Romania in September to replace production previously done in Russia. The company's operating profit fell to EUR 4.1 million from EUR 8.3 million a year ago, while net sales rose by 14% in comparable currencies to EUR 314 million. CEO Jukka Moisio noted an increase in market share, indicating improved product availability in Central Europe and the Nordic countries. However, the overall car and tyre markets remain weak, and economic uncertainty complicates predictions for market and consumer behavior. The company will also have a new CEO, Paolo Pompei, by the end of the year.",
