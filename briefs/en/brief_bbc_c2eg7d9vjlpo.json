    "news_text": "Former Welsh mineworkers are calling on the UK government to release \u00a32.3 billion in reserves from the British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme (BCSSS) pension scheme. Despite the government releasing funds from the Mineworkers Pension Scheme (MPS) in October, BCSSS funds remain frozen. Many former miners, including Lindsey Hopkins, express frustration over the disparity between the two schemes and the government's handling of their pensions. They argue that the funds are rightfully theirs and are needed to support their livelihoods, especially as many are struggling with the cost of living. The government has not taken any money from the scheme's surpluses since 2015, but the situation remains unresolved.",
