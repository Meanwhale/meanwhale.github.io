    "news_text": "The situation in Goma, DRC, has deteriorated with over 100 deaths and nearly 1,000 injuries reported due to clashes between Congolese armed forces and M23 rebels, who have taken control of the city airport. President Tshisekedi is expected to speak to the public on Wednesday, while a virtual meeting of the Eastern African community is scheduled in Kenya. The US Secretary of State has called for a ceasefire, and both the UN and African Union have urged the M23 rebels to disarm. The DRC government is dissatisfied with the lack of explicit mention of Rwanda in international statements, as tensions rise over Rwanda's alleged interest in Congo's mineral resources.",
