    "news_text": "Recent rate cuts and rising stock prices have provided some positive news for Hong Kong's property market, yet challenges remain due to a weak economy and cautious pricing from developers. With 109,000 housing units available, pressure on secondary market prices is expected to continue. JLL's Bruce Pang emphasizes that while government policy easing has improved affordability, it hasn't restored buyer confidence. Primary market transactions have exceeded 2023 totals, driven by cash-rich buyers, but high activity levels may not be sustainable. Developers are adopting conservative pricing strategies, as seen with SHKP's recent launch of units at the lowest price in seven years for new projects outside Kai Tak. Experts believe that demand will shift towards the primary market, exerting downward pressure on secondary prices, and a sustained recovery in homebuying sentiment will depend on broader economic improvements.",
