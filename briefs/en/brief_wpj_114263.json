    "news_text": "Recent rate cuts and rising stock prices have provided some positive indicators for Hong Kong's property market, yet challenges remain due to a weak economy and cautious pricing from developers. With 109,000 housing units available and a potential increase in primary market activity, pressure on secondary market prices is expected to continue. JLL's Bruce Pang emphasized that while government policy easing has improved affordability, it has not restored buyer confidence. The primary market has seen increased transactions, but this level of activity may not be sustainable. Developers are adopting conservative pricing strategies, as evidenced by SHKP's recent launch of units at the lowest price in seven years for new projects outside Kai Tak. Experts suggest that while stock market gains could positively affect property sentiment, a full recovery in homebuying confidence will depend on broader economic improvements.",
