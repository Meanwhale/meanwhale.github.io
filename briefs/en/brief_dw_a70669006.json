    "news_text": "On a sunny Tuesday afternoon in Washington, college students Noah and Liam are excitedly waiting to hear Vice President Kamala Harris deliver a key speech as she campaigns for the presidency. The atmosphere is positive, and the two friends believe that a woman in the White House could bring necessary change. Polls indicate that young male voters are a contested group this election cycle, with Harris leading among young women and men, but a significant gender gap remains. Some young males, like Kevin, support Trump for his economic policies, while others, like Neil, are passionate Trump supporters, emphasizing traditional male traits. The shift of Black male voters towards Trump is concerning for the Harris campaign, prompting former President Obama to address the issue. First-time voters Justin and Joseph, however, are enthusiastic supporters of Harris, reflecting a desire for change in leadership.",
