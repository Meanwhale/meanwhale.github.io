This warning follows a recent Israeli offensive in northern Gaza, which has resulted in significant civilian casualties and a deteriorating humanitarian situation. The letter expresses deep concerns over Israel's actions that have impeded humanitarian movements and calls for urgent measures to increase aid supplies. The US emphasizes the need for Israel to allow a minimum of 350 aid lorries daily and to end the isolation of northern Gaza.
