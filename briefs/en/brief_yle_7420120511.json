    "news_text": "Research conducted by the University of Helsinki has uncovered new insights into the genetic heritage of Southwest Finns, indicating that a considerable part of their genetics comes from the Baltic region. The study focused on men's Y chromosomes and found that Southwest Finns share genetic similarities with Estonians, as well as with other regions in Finland. Utilizing data from the National Institute for Health and Welfare, the research identified that most contemporary Finnish men belong to either the N or I haplo group, with the N-haplo group likely arriving from the Baltics. These findings are corroborated by linguistic and archaeological evidence, suggesting a close relationship between the Estonian language and the genetic makeup of Southwest Finns.",
