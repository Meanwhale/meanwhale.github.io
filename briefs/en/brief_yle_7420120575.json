    "news_text": "According to a report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have risen by over 10% in the last two decades, with levels in 2023 reaching 420.0 ppm, a 51% increase since 1750. This rise is largely attributed to fossil fuel use and cement production. The current CO2 levels are comparable to those from 3-5 million years ago when global temperatures were 2-3 degrees higher. While emissions have stabilized, the long-term effects of CO2 in the atmosphere remain concerning, as it can persist for thousands of years. The report also highlights that emissions from large vegetation fires and reduced forest carbon sinks have contributed to the increase in CO2 levels.",
