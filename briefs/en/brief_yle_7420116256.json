    "news_text": "The Nobel Prize announcements for 2023 are taking place throughout the week, with the chemistry prize to be revealed on Wednesday, literature on Thursday, and the peace prize in Oslo on Friday. This year's physics Nobel has been awarded to John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey E. Hinton for their groundbreaking discoveries that enable machine learning through artificial neural networks. Hopfield, a 91-year-old professor at Princeton University, and 76-year-old Hinton from the University of Toronto, expressed surprise at the recognition. Their work is considered foundational for machine learning and artificial intelligence, with applications already evident in fields like solar cell production and climate modeling. Hinton emphasized the transformative potential of AI, likening its impact on humanity to that of the Industrial Revolution. However, concerns about AI's unchecked development were also raised. Earlier in the week, the medicine prize was awarded to Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for their research on micro-RNA and gene regulation. The economics Nobel will be announced on Monday, and all winners will receive their medals, certificates, and a cash prize at the Nobel gala in Stockholm in December.",
