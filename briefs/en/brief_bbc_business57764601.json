    "news_text": "The Bank of England is anticipated to lower interest rates from the current 5% during a meeting on Thursday, marking the first reduction in over four years. This change will influence mortgage, credit card, and savings rates for millions in the UK. Although inflation has decreased, the Bank remains cautious about cutting rates too quickly to avoid economic damage. The current inflation rate is significantly lower than last year's peak, and analysts expect a gradual reduction in rates. The impact on mortgage rates and borrowing costs is significant, with many homeowners facing higher payments compared to previous years.",
