    "news_text": "G\u00f6bekli Tepe, discovered in 1994, is an archaeological site in Turkey dating back 11,500 years, challenging previous beliefs about hunter-gatherers' capabilities. The site has become a focal point for conspiracy theories and alternative archaeology, particularly through figures like Graham Hancock, who claims it suggests a lost Ice Age civilization. Archaeologists like Flint Dibble argue against these theories, emphasizing the need for scientific scrutiny. The rise of social media has amplified these debates, leading to a so-called 'archaeological war' between proponents of traditional archaeology and those promoting alternative narratives. Despite the controversies, ongoing excavations continue to reveal more about G\u00f6bekli Tepe and its significance in human history.",
