    "news_text": "According to brain researcher Kerttu Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 from the University of Turku, our fear of horror movies lingers because we anticipate their events. Editor Noora Takam\u00e4ki elaborates on the fascination with horror, noting that dark settings signal impending danger. The brain processes fear through two systems: the frontal lobe, which assesses threats, and the limbic system, which triggers automatic responses like fight or flight. High-quality horror films effectively engage both systems. The most terrifying types of horror involve elements that are strange, inhuman, or incomprehensible, as people often fear the unknown.",
