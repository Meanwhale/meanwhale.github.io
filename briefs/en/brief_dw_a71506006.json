    "news_text": "In the past week, Santorini has been shaken by hundreds of earthquakes, prompting the evacuation of about 6,000 locals and tourists. The Greek Seismological Service noted that no main quake has been observed, and ongoing low-level tremors have been occurring since June 2024. Experts suggest two scenarios: a &#x27;seismic swarm&#x27; with minimal damage or a larger earthquake over magnitude 5. While the risk of a tsunami is low, residents are advised to seek higher ground due to landslides and rock falls.",
