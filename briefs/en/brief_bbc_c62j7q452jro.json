    "news_text": "The UK government has announced a 4.6% increase in regulated train fares in England, effective from March 2, 2025, along with a \u00a35 rise in most railcard prices. These changes were not mentioned in the Chancellor's Budget speech but were included in the Treasury's budget document. The increase is one percentage point above the July Retail Prices Index inflation rate and is the lowest rise in three years. Critics argue that raising fares above inflation is detrimental to low-income public transport users, while rail organizations emphasize the need to encourage more train travel rather than increasing costs for current passengers. Other budget measures include tax increases and a rise in the cap on single bus fares.",
