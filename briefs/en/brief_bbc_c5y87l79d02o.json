    "news_text": "The Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) announced that Comet A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS), dubbed the 'comet of the century', could be visible to the naked eye in the UK on Saturday evening. Expected to come within 70 million km of Earth, the comet was first seen in the southern hemisphere last month and will be visible until October 30. Dr. Robert Massey from RAS advised viewers to look west after sunset from higher ground and suggested using binoculars. He noted that the comet's nucleus is approximately 2 km long and encouraged people to enjoy the viewing experience. Additionally, the UK recently experienced the Northern Lights, which Dr. Massey described as a coincidence.",
