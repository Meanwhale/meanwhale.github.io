    "news_text": "The Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) announced that Comet A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS), referred to as the 'comet of the century', could be visible in the UK on Saturday night as it approaches within 70 million km of Earth. Dr. Robert Massey from RAS advised viewers to look west after sunset from higher ground, as skies are expected to clear. The comet was first seen in the southern hemisphere in early October and will be visible until October 30. Its nucleus is estimated to be 2 km long, and while comets can sometimes be disappointing, this one appears to meet predictions. The comet follows a recent display of the Northern Lights across the UK, which Dr. Massey described as a coincidence.",
