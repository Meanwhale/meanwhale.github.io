    "news_text": "Firefighters are currently fighting a rapidly spreading fire in southern California, known as the Hughes fire, which has expanded to over 10,000 acres and forced tens of thousands to evacuate. The fire is exacerbated by strong winds, and authorities have issued a red-flag warning for the area. Despite some control achieved, the situation remains critical, especially with the forecast of rain that could lead to mudslides in fire-affected areas. Other smaller fires have also been reported, but evacuation orders are being lifted in some regions.",
