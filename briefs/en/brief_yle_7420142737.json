    "news_text": "Klaus Johannis, the President of Romania, has announced his resignation, effective Wednesday, as his second term was set to end on December 21. This decision follows the National Constitutional Court&#x27;s annulment of the November elections, citing Russian electoral influence. The court ruled that the first round of presidential elections must be reorganized to ensure legitimacy. New elections are planned for May. Despite the Supreme Court&#x27;s previous stance that Johannis should remain until a successor is determined, pressure from extreme right-wing parties led to his resignation. Ilie Bolojan, the leader of the Liberal Party, will temporarily take over presidential duties. The political situation has been tumultuous, especially after the first round was won by Calin Georgescu, who has been associated with extreme right-wing views and alleged Russian support. Georgescu has denied any wrongdoing and has appealed to the EU Court of Human Rights, which rejected his appeal.",
