    "news_text": "Genetic engineering has evolved from traditional cross-breeding to modern gene editing, allowing precise DNA modifications in organisms. This technology promises more productive and disease-resistant crops and livestock. Countries like Japan and the US are already developing gene-edited foods, while the UK has paused legislation for gene-edited food sales. Proponents argue it could reduce animal suffering and combat climate change, while opponents raise safety and animal welfare concerns. The UK government is considering regulatory frameworks, but stricter EU regulations pose challenges. Experts emphasize the need for ethical oversight and public trust in gene editing to ensure it benefits both agriculture and animal welfare.",
