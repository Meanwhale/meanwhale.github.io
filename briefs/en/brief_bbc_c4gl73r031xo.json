    "news_text": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has accused India of a significant error regarding its alleged involvement in the murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil. This accusation follows Canadian officials' claims of India's involvement in violent acts against Indian dissidents in Canada. In response, both nations expelled diplomats, heightening existing tensions. India has dismissed the allegations as absurd and accused Trudeau of seeking political favor from the Sikh community. Trudeau stated he received intelligence indicating India's involvement in Nijjar's killing, which he described as a violation of Canadian sovereignty. Although police have charged four Indian nationals in connection with the murder, Trudeau noted that the intelligence did not constitute hard evidence. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) disclosed ongoing investigations due to threats against pro-Khalistan members, linking them to alleged criminal activities by Indian agents. Following these developments, the UK and US have urged India to cooperate with Canada's investigation, emphasizing the seriousness of the allegations.",
