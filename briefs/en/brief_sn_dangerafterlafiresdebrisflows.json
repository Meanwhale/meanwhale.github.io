    "news_text": "The Los Angeles wildfires have left behind charred soil and vegetation, making the region more susceptible to debris flows and landslides following rainfall. Scientists are assessing the risk, as debris flows can carry significant sediment and debris, posing a serious threat to life and property. Emergency planners are on high alert as they track weather patterns that could trigger these dangerous flows, which can occur rapidly after rainfall. Precautions are being taken to protect communities, but the risk can persist for years after a fire.",
