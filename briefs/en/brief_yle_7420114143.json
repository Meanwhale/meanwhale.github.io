    "news_header": "Pensions will see a smaller increase next year due to reduced inflation, leading to higher taxpayer costs and potential tax impacts on pensioners.",
    "news_text": "Pensions are set to rise significantly less than in previous years, with taxpayers expected to spend hundreds of euros on the upcoming index increase. After two years of substantial pension increases linked to high inflation, the trend is reversing as inflation has decreased. The National Federation of Taxpayers indicates a 1% index increase for earnings-related pensions at year-end. While index increases generally benefit pensions, government tax cuts may offset these benefits for pensioners. Tax tightening could reduce pension increases by several hundred euros for certain income groups. The government's decision to reduce pension income taxation aims to increase tax revenues, but overall tax rates may rise due to changes in pension income. Additionally, pensioners face increased health care costs and potential cuts to housing allowances. The government views pensions as a target for budget adjustments, with discussions of possible pension cuts ongoing.",
