    "news_text": "US President Joe Biden has made a formal apology to Native Americans for the 150-year-old policy of Indian boarding schools, marking him as the first president to do so. From 1819 to the 1970s, indigenous children were forcibly taken from their homes and placed in federal boarding schools aimed at assimilating them into white American culture, stripping them of their heritage. During his visit to the Gila Crossing Community School in Arizona, Biden described the program as a 'sin on our soul' and a 'blot on American history.' While the Biden administration claims to have allocated billions to support indigenous communities, there are calls for further action.",
