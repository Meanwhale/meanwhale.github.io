    "news_text": "Apple, Google, and Microsoft are collaborating to eliminate passwords, introducing key codes as an alternative login method. The FIDO Alliance noted a decline in password-based key codes, with services like Google launching this technology in May 2023. While experts see potential in this approach, they express concerns about the heavy reliance on single devices, which could lead to security issues if the device is lost or compromised. Cybersecurity specialists highlight the problems with traditional passwords, such as memory limitations and the risk of recycling passwords across services. The success of key codes may depend on collaboration among tech companies, similar to how Finnish banks unified their electronic identification systems, leading to increased transaction volumes. However, experts warn that as technology evolves, new security challenges may arise, necessitating careful consideration from policymakers and the media.",
