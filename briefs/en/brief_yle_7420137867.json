    "news_text": "Otzma Yehudit, an extreme right-wing party, plans to resign from Prime Minister Netanyahu's government due to dissatisfaction with the Gaza ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement, which they view as a surrender to Hamas. They argue that the ceasefire undermines the Israeli army's achievements and will release 'hundreds of murderers' in the form of Palestinian prisoners. Despite their resignation, it is not sufficient to topple the government. Netanyahu has stated that the ceasefire allows for continued fighting if Hamas does not comply, while National Security Minister Ben-Gvir insists on returning to war as Hamas remains undefeated. The ceasefire and exchange agreement is set to take effect on Sunday morning.",
