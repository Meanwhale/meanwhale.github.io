    "news_text": "Recent DNA analysis of Iron Age skeletons in southern England reveals that Celtic women, particularly from the Durotrigian community, maintained their social standing by marrying men from outside their communities, a practice known as matrilocality. This arrangement allowed women to have greater control over household and community affairs. The study found genetic evidence of matrilocality among 57 individuals from Iron Age cemeteries, indicating that most individuals shared maternal ancestry, while many men did not, suggesting they migrated into these female-led societies. The findings align with historical accounts of powerful Celtic women and indicate a complex social structure that varied across regions.",
