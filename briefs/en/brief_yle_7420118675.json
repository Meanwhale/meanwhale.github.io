    "news_text": "Ville Niinn, President of the European Parliament\u2019s Russia delegation, criticized Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelensky\u2019s victory plan as unrealistic, emphasizing that Ukraine's capabilities and Western support are insufficient to achieve its objectives. The Foreign Policy Institute researcher noted the difficulty in changing Zelensky's promises to Ukrainians, who expect a commitment to territorial integrity and victory. Zelensky recently outlined his plan in Brussels, which includes NATO membership, defense against Russian aggression, economic growth, and post-war security. Antti Helanter\u00e4, the Finnish Ambassador, acknowledged the importance of Ukraine initiating peace discussions, despite the lack of visible results. The situation raises questions about Russia's response as Ukraine seeks to strengthen ties with NATO amid ongoing conflict.",
