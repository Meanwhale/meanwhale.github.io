    "news_text": "Medical licentiate Maria Peltola's research at the University of Tampere indicates that celiac disease may be associated with the development of difficult-to-treat epilepsy, a connection that has not been previously recognized. The study found that among patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis, 20% exhibited autoimmune responses related to celiac disease. Overall, 9% of the 253 patients studied had celiac-related autoimmunity. This unexpected finding suggests that gluten-induced immune reactions might contribute to the development of difficult-to-treat epilepsy and hippocampal damage. While the prevalence of celiac disease is higher in epilepsy patients than expected, the study did not explore how a gluten-free diet might affect disease progression. Current treatment for hippocampal sclerosis primarily involves surgical removal of the seizure-causing brain tissue. Peltola's dissertation defense is scheduled for October 18 at the University of Tampere.",
