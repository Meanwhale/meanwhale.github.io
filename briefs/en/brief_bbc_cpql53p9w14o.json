    "news_text": "A new analysis by the Food Foundation reveals that healthy food costs over double that of unhealthy options, with 1,000 calories of healthy food costing \u00a38.80 compared to \u00a34.30 for unhealthy food. The charity warns that low-income families are struggling to afford healthy diets, with 60% of households facing food insecurity reducing their fruit intake. The government plans to introduce a food strategy to address unhealthy diets, but the gap in food prices has widened, with healthy food prices rising by 21% in the last two years. The Food Foundation calls for government incentives to make healthy food more affordable.",
