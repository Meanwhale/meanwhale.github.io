    "news_text": "Israeli troops had been searching for Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, for over a year following the October 7 attacks. He was believed to be hiding in Gaza's tunnels with bodyguards and hostages. Sinwar was ultimately killed during an encounter with an Israeli patrol in Rafah, where he was found alone without hostages. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed his death after identifying his body through a finger sample. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that this marked a blow against 'evil', but emphasized that the war in Gaza would continue until all hostages are rescued. Families of hostages expressed hope for a ceasefire to bring their loved ones home.",
