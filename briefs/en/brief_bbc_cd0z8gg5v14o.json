    "news_text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has unveiled a 'victory plan' aimed at strengthening Ukraine's position to potentially end the war with Russia by next year. Key elements include a formal NATO invitation, lifting bans on long-range strikes, and a refusal to concede territory. The Kremlin dismissed the plan, urging Ukraine to reassess its approach. Zelensky criticized countries supporting Russia and emphasized the need for continued military support from allies. Despite growing fatigue in Ukraine, he remains firm on not ceding territory, framing the situation as an existential struggle. The plan has been shared with key allies, including the US, who expressed concerns about its comprehensiveness. NATO's Secretary General acknowledged the plan as a strong signal from Kyiv, while the Kremlin reiterated its stance against Ukraine's current policies.",
