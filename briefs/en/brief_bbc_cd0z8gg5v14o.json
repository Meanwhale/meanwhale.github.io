    "news_text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has unveiled a 'victory plan' aimed at strengthening Ukraine's position to end the war with Russia, which began in February 2022. He presented this plan to parliament, stating it could conclude the conflict by next year. Key components include a formal invitation to join NATO, lifting restrictions on long-range strikes against Russia, and a firm stance against trading Ukrainian territories. Zelensky criticized countries like China, Iran, and North Korea for supporting Russia and referred to them as a 'coalition of criminals.' Despite acknowledging growing fatigue among Ukrainians, he emphasized the need to maintain military pressure on Russia without conceding territory. The Kremlin dismissed the plan, suggesting Ukraine needs to reassess its approach. Zelensky's plan has been shared with key allies and is seen as a potential investment opportunity for Western nations, but its success hinges on continued support from the U.S. and other allies.",
