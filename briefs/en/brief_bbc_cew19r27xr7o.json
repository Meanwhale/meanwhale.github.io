    "news_text": "The United States has imposed sanctions on two Chinese companies, Xiamen Limbach Aircraft Engine Co and Redlepus Vector Industry Shenzhen Co, for their roles in producing drones used by Russia in the Ukraine conflict. The sanctions also target Russian intermediary Artem Yamshchikov. This action coincides with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's address to the EU Council, where he accused China of aiding Russia and outlined a 'victory plan' that includes applying military pressure on Russia and seeking NATO membership. Zelensky emphasized the need for long-range missiles to defend Ukraine effectively and called for continued sanctions against Russia to support Ukraine's efforts. While allies have shown support, they have not yet endorsed Zelensky's plan.",
