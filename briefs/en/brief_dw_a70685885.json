    "news_text": "Earlier this year, 45 German firms launched a 4-day workweek project monitored by M\u00fcnster University. Employees worked fewer hours without pay cuts, aiming for higher productivity. Researchers used various methods, including stress analysis and fitness tracking, to evaluate effects. Results showed improved employee well-being and productivity, with participants reporting less stress and better health. However, some companies did not fully implement the reduced hours, and the study's representativeness was questioned. Despite skepticism from labor experts, over 70% of participating companies plan to continue the project.",
