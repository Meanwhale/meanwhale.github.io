    "news_text": "Germany had been free of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) since 1988 until the virus was found in a water buffalo herd in Brandenburg in January 2025. Local authorities confirmed three deaths in the herd, which was subsequently culled. South Korea banned pork imports from Germany. Agriculture Minister Cem \u00d6zdemir warned that a return to normalcy would take time. FMD is a highly contagious viral infection affecting cloven-hoofed animals, causing blisters and can be transmitted through various means. While FMD can be deadly for animals, human infections are rare and usually mild. There is no treatment for FMD, and if one animal is infected, the entire herd is culled to prevent spread.",
