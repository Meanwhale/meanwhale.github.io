    "news_original_title": "Key power station didn&#x27;t properly disclose burning forest wood",
    "news_text": "Drax Power Station, which generates about 6% of the UK&#x27;s electricity and has received billions in government subsidies, has failed multiple times to report that it burned wood sourced from primary forests. An investigation by the BBC revealed that Drax misreported sustainability data, including wood sourced from untouched natural forests, which is against regulations. The company faced a \u00a325 million penalty last year for similar misreporting. Although Drax claims to be focusing on improving its practices, public records indicate it still sources whole trees from primary forests. Ofgem, the energy regulator, has mandated a full audit of Drax&#x27;s supply chain to ensure compliance with sustainability criteria, which may be revised in the future.",
