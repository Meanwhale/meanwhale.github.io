    "news_text": "At Loch Long in Argyll, Scotland, a major plastic pollution issue arises, with around 62,000 items of litter washing ashore each year, primarily from Glasgow&#x27;s waterways. Local residents struggle to clean the waste, much of which is entangled in seaweed. Campaigners advocate for a deposit return scheme for bottles and cans to prevent waste from entering water bodies. Although a Scottish scheme was initially set for 2023, it faced delays due to business objections and UK government considerations for a unified scheme. The target date has now been pushed to 2027. Meanwhile, Ireland&#x27;s successful deposit return scheme has shown positive results, capturing nearly a billion items in its first year. Scottish officials hope to boost recycling rates and reduce littering through the new scheme, with a commitment to implement it by 2027.",
