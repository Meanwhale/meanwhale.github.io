    "news_text": "Roman Abramovich, a sanctioned Russian oligarch, could owe the UK up to \u00a31bn after a failed attempt to avoid tax on hedge fund investments. Evidence suggests that investments worth $6bn were managed from the UK, despite being routed through companies in the British Virgin Islands. Some funds that supported Chelsea FC during Abramovich's ownership can be traced back to these investments. His lawyers claim he acted on expert tax advice and denies any wrongdoing. A parliamentary group is urging an investigation by HM Revenue and Customs to recover significant amounts for public services. The scheme's key figure, Eugene Shvidler, is also under scrutiny for his role in managing these investments from the UK.",
