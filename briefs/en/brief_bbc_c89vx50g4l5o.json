    "news_text": "Hezbollah has announced that Naim Qassem will succeed Hassan Nasrallah as the group's new head after Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli air strike in Beirut last month. Qassem, who served as deputy secretary general for over 30 years, was elected by the Shura Council. His current location is uncertain, with reports suggesting he may have fled to Iran. The leadership transition comes amid escalating conflict in Lebanon, with Israel conducting air strikes targeting Hezbollah operatives and infrastructure, resulting in significant casualties. The ongoing hostilities have led to over 2,700 deaths and nearly 12,500 injuries in Lebanon over the past year.",
