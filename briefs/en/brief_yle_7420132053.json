    "news_header": "The text discusses the disparity between public trust in science and the acceptance of scientific findings, particularly regarding homeopathy and nutrition. It highlights the challenges decision-makers face when balancing scientific expertise with voter preferences, noting that the Finnish government claims to support science but often does not act accordingly.",
    "news_text": "The article by Pekka Sepp\u00e4nen examines the contradiction in Finnish public opinion regarding science. While 86% of Finns express trust in science, a significant portion believes in homeopathy, which lacks scientific backing. The government professes to value scientific expertise in decision-making, yet often prioritizes voter preferences over scientific evidence, as seen in policies like household tax reductions. This reflects a broader issue where public sentiment can undermine scientific consensus, leading to questionable policy decisions.",
