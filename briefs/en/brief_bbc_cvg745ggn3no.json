    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a change to the UK's debt measurement rules to allow for up to \u00a350 billion in additional borrowing for infrastructure projects, aiming to stimulate economic growth and job creation. Despite this, the upcoming Budget is expected to involve cuts to public services and tax increases, particularly affecting businesses. Reeves emphasized the need for oversight on investment spending to ensure value for money, while opposition from shadow chancellor Jeremy Hunt highlighted concerns about rising interest rates impacting families. The government aims to define 'working people' for tax purposes and is committed to reforming public services to improve productivity. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer supported the debt rule changes, indicating a proactive approach to economic challenges. However, experts warn that broader debt measures could unsettle financial markets.",
