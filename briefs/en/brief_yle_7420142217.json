    "news_text": "Icelandic Borealis is building a paper mill in an old warehouse within a data center, utilizing durable and renewable wood materials. Sales manager Halld\u00f3r M\u00e1r S\u00e6mundsson highlights the coincidence of the paper mill&#x27;s history with the new data center. The wood elements are sourced locally from Crosslam, with CEO Ville Manninen viewing the project as a stepping stone for future contracts. Borealis aims to create facilities for clients with cloud services and supercomputers, while acknowledging the competitive landscape and the need for careful planning. The data center boom in Finland is evident, with new projects emerging, including a significant Canadian plan for a 500-megawatt facility. However, job creation remains limited, as noted by Tero Tuonononen, emphasizing the importance of local companies engaging in the sector. Borealis is committed to using local resources and involving the community in its projects.",
