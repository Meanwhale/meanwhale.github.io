    "news_text": "Ofcom has proposed that Royal Mail should only deliver second-class letters and parcels every other weekday and not on Saturdays to reform the Universal Service Obligation (USO) due to declining letter volumes and rising stamp prices. While first-class letters would still be delivered six days a week, second-class deliveries would be limited. The regulator noted that Royal Mail's delivery performance has been lacking, leading to fines, and suggested reducing next-day delivery targets. The number of letters delivered has significantly decreased, while stamp prices have risen. Changes to second-class deliveries could save Royal Mail between \u00a3250m and \u00a3425m, allowing for improved reliability and resource allocation. The proposals have faced objections from the Post Office, and a public consultation is open until April 2025.",
