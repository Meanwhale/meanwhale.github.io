    "news_text": "Kamala Harris, a presidential candidate, condemned Donald Trump's recent speech as a sign of danger, highlighting his use of aggressive rhetoric just weeks before the election. Trump has labeled his political opponents as 'internal enemies' and suggested that the military may be needed to handle dissenters. His comments have raised concerns among journalists and even some Republicans, with fears that such rhetoric could threaten democracy. Harris emphasized the seriousness of Trump's statements, warning that they target journalists and election officials who oppose him. Analysts note that Trump's language is typical of right-wing populists, but its vagueness allows for varied interpretations, potentially creating divisions within the Democratic Party. Harris also expressed concern for Trump's mental state after a peculiar public appearance. Overall, the situation reflects a tense political climate as the election approaches.",
