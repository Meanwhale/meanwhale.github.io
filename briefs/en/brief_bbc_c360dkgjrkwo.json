    "news_text": "In a crucial meeting at the White House, Donald Trump is expected to encounter fierce resistance from Jordan&#x27;s King Abdullah over Trump&#x27;s controversial proposal to move Gaza&#x27;s population to Jordan. This plan has raised significant concerns in Jordan, a key US ally, which is balancing military and diplomatic ties with popular support for Palestinians. The proposal has sparked fears of destabilizing Jordan, which already hosts many refugees. King Abdullah&#x27;s message to Trump is clear: any attempt to push Gazans into Jordan would be seen as a declaration of war. The situation is further complicated by Trump&#x27;s threats to withhold aid if Jordan and Egypt do not accept Palestinian refugees.",
