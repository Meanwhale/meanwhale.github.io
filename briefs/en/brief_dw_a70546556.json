    "news_text": "Imran Khan, ousted from power in 2022 and sentenced to 10 years for corruption, claims the US and Pakistan's military orchestrated his removal. His supporters criticize the Biden administration for ignoring Khan and believe Trump's potential return to the presidency could benefit Khan. Analysts note that US-Pakistan relations have historically been more stable under Republican administrations, and the US's influence in Pakistan's politics is often exaggerated. The Pakistani military's role is deemed more crucial than any politician, including Khan, in the context of US interests in the region.",
