    "news_text": "Pune, India, is experiencing a rise in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) cases, with 111 identified in the last three weeks. The first casualty, a 41-year-old man, died from the syndrome, which affects the nervous system and can lead to paralysis. Experts suspect contaminated water as a potential cause, and local authorities are conducting tests. GBS is an autoimmune disorder where the immune system mistakenly attacks peripheral nerve cells, leading to symptoms like muscle weakness and breathing difficulties. There is no definitive cure, but treatments like plasma exchange and immunoglobulin therapy can aid recovery.",
