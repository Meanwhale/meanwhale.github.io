    "news_text": "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol appeared in court facing rebellion charges and impeachment related to his brief martial law declaration in December. Security was tight as he contested his arrest and sought to revoke the order. The Constitutional Court is nearing a decision on his impeachment, with final arguments scheduled for February 25. Yoon&#x27;s martial law imposition is alleged to have aimed at shutting down the National Assembly and arresting political opponents. His presidential powers were suspended following impeachment, and he continues to face significant political turmoil, including the indictment of several officials associated with his martial law decree.",
