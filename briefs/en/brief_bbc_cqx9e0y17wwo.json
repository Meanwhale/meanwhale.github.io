    "news_text": "Twitter was launched in 2006 by Jack Dorsey with a simple tweet. It allowed users to interact without approval, attracting companies eager to engage with customers. Elon Musk joined in 2010 and later bought the platform for $44 billion, implementing major changes, including a focus on free speech and significant staff layoffs. His ownership has led to a 'great X-odus', with brands leaving due to concerns over content and public perception. Controversial posts by Musk have influenced public opinion in the UK, and many companies, including Apple and Disney, have paused advertising. Some organizations, like FC St Pauli, have left due to rising hate speech. Despite the challenges, some still find value in using X for customer engagement.",
