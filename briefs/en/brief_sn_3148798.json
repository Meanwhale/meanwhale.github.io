    "news_text": "Recent genetic research has clarified the evolutionary position of the marsupial mole, an elusive Australian mammal. Contrary to previous beliefs, it is more closely related to kangaroos than to traditional moles. The study, led by Stephen Frankenberg and colleagues, utilized a frozen sample from the South Australian Museum to analyze the animal's phylogeny. The marsupial mole exhibits unique adaptations for its underground lifestyle, including a backward-facing pouch and specialized limbs, while lacking external ears and functional eyes. This research highlights the evolutionary divergence of marsupial moles from other mammals and their relationship with bilbies and bandicoots.",
