    "news_text": "Cuba has experienced one of its worst weeks in years due to a nationwide blackout that left around 10 million people without power for several days. The situation worsened with Hurricane Oscar causing significant damage along the northeastern coast. Many Cubans, like Yusely Perez in Havana, have resorted to using firewood for cooking due to a lack of liquified gas deliveries. The Cuban government attributes the energy crisis to the US economic embargo, while critics point to mismanagement and prioritization of tourism over energy infrastructure. Despite assurances from officials, the electrical grid continues to fail, leading to widespread discontent. In rural areas like Aguacate, residents have been living without reliable electricity for extended periods, exacerbating issues like food and water shortages. The recent hurricane added to the challenges, highlighting the fragility of Cuba's energy system and the potential for future blackouts.",
