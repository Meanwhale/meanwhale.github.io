    "news_text": "The UN's special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, condemned Israel following air strikes in Nabatieh that killed mayor Ahmad Kahil and 15 others, including municipal staff aiding civilians. Lebanon's caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, described the attack as intentional against a council meeting. The strikes, part of Israel's campaign against Hezbollah, have raised alarms about the safety of Lebanese state infrastructure. Previous attacks have damaged historic sites, and a recent strike in Beirut was criticized by the US for its impact on civilians. Israel claims to have taken steps to minimize civilian harm, but human rights organizations argue that these warnings are inadequate. The UN human rights office has called for an investigation into the air strikes, highlighting concerns over compliance with international humanitarian law.",
