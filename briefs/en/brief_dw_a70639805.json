    "news_text": "JD Vance's political journey has been remarkable, transitioning from a bestselling author critical of Donald Trump to his running mate in 2024. Raised by his grandparents in Ohio, Vance served in the Marines and later became a venture capitalist after graduating from prestigious universities. His book 'Hillbilly Elegy' gained national attention, reflecting the struggles of the Rust Belt. Despite past criticisms of Trump, Vance has embraced the MAGA movement and is viewed as a leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2028. His campaign has not been without controversy, including inflammatory remarks and a refusal to acknowledge Trump's 2020 election loss.",
