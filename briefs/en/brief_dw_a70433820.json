    "news_text": "After Iran launched a significant missile strike on Israel, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu warned of severe repercussions, hinting at potential attacks on Iran's critical oil and military infrastructure. This escalation has raised concerns about a spike in global oil prices, especially if Israel targets major oil facilities like Kharg Island, which is crucial for Iran's oil exports. While some analysts speculate about the economic impact of such actions, others believe that an outright military confrontation is unlikely due to the potential for wider regional conflict. The situation remains tense, with both sides wary of escalating violence that could involve the US and neighboring countries.",
