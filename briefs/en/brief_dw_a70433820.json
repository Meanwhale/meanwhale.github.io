    "news_text": "After Iran launched 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu warned of significant retaliation, potentially targeting Iran's oil and military infrastructure. This comes amid rising oil prices, which spiked due to the conflict. Analysts speculate that an Israeli attack on Iran's oil facilities could drastically affect global oil supply, possibly pushing prices above $200 per barrel. Iran's economy heavily relies on oil exports, and any disruption could have severe consequences. While some suggest Israel might target oil facilities, experts believe it may focus on military installations instead to avoid escalating tensions further. The situation remains precarious, with high stakes for both nations and the global economy.",
