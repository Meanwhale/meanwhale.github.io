    "news_text": "John Mark Dugan, an American man and former Florida Deputy Sheriff, has left Moscow and is reportedly collaborating with the Russian military intelligence service GRU. According to the Washington Post, Dugan has been involved in creating and disseminating false information regarding the election campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. He has received funding from a senior GRU official and has established multiple fake news sites, which have garnered up to 64 million views since September 2023. Dugan's operations are noted for their understanding of Western audience dynamics, and he is suspected of being involved in a disinformation campaign that included a fake video targeting Tim Walz, a Democratic Party vice president. US intelligence officials have linked this video to Russian production. Dugan has made statements suggesting that the West is dishonest about current events, and he has been compared to historical figures like Grigori Rasputin in terms of influence.",
