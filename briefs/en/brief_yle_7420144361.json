    "news_text": "This marks a shift in the US&#x27;s approach towards Russia, which has been isolated during the ongoing conflict. The last meeting between the two countries&#x27; foreign ministers was nearly two years ago, and previous encounters did not yield significant progress towards ending the war. The Russian delegation insists on negotiating solely with the US, excluding European involvement. While Ukraine&#x27;s President Zelensky is in the region, the Ukrainian government has not been invited to the talks.",
