    "news_text": "Anna-Cristiina Korhonen reports that the costs of a shareholder agreement for the West Bank may not fit into next year's budget. Ongoing negotiations involve Turku, Espoo, Salo, Vihti, Lohja, and Kirkkonummi, while Helsinki will not participate. A preliminary agreement allocated 400 million shares from the municipalities and an additional 400 million euros from the state, but approximately 500 million euros are needed. Following the refusal of EU funding, there has been criticism regarding the costs. The municipalities are eager to include planning costs in next year's budget, but Salon's contribution remains unclear. Future discussions on financial matters are scheduled, with the next meeting set for Wednesday.",
