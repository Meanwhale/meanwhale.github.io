    "news_original_title": "Hong Kong&#x27;s main opposition party announces plan to dissolve",
    "news_text": "The Democratic Party of Hong Kong, once the largest opposition group, is set to dissolve after 31 years. Chairman Lo Kin-hei announced that members will vote on the decision, which comes amid a crackdown on dissent following the 2019 protests. Beijing&#x27;s &#x27;patriots law&#x27; has barred the party from participating in elections, significantly weakening its influence. Lo expressed that developing democracy in Hong Kong has become increasingly challenging. The party&#x27;s leaders cited the current political climate as a reason for the dissolution. A work group has been established to manage the shutdown process, requiring at least 75% member approval at an upcoming meeting. Government adviser Regina Ip criticized the party for opposing China and causing disruptions. The party had previously engaged in negotiations with the Chinese government but faced backlash from younger members. Many prominent members are currently jailed or in exile due to national security laws, further diminishing the party&#x27;s standing.",
