    "news_text": "The UK-built BepiColombo spacecraft has successfully completed its sixth and final flyby of Mercury, capturing new images of the planet as it flew 295km above its surface. Launched in 2018, BepiColombo consists of two satellites designed to gather data for at least a year, requiring special shielding to endure the sun's heat. This flyby marks the last opportunity for close-up images before the spacecraft separates from its satellites. The mission aims to investigate Mercury's composition and the potential existence of water in its craters. The main mission phase will commence in two years, with scientists eager to analyze the data collected.",
