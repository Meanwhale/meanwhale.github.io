    "news_text": "President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of Congo has pledged to restore government control in the east, where M23 rebels, allegedly supported by Rwanda, have taken Goma and are advancing south. He criticized the international community for inaction and called for a united effort to support the army. The ongoing conflict has displaced around 500,000 people and worsened the humanitarian crisis. Regional leaders have urged direct engagement with the M23, but Tshisekedi refuses to negotiate directly with them. Tensions have escalated between South Africa and Rwanda over the conflict, with calls for urgent talks between Congolese and Rwandan leaders.",
