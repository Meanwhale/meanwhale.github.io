    "news_text": "Innovestor has introduced a system to utilize battery-stored solar energy to mitigate price spikes in the electricity market. By integrating solar energy production and storage in various office buildings across Finland, the company plans to meet the growing electricity demand from transportation and industry electrification. The project aims to install battery systems in 30 office buildings by mid-2026, capable of storing a total of 60 megawatt-hours of electricity. This system will allow excess solar energy to be stored and sold back to the market, helping to stabilize electricity prices, especially during low wind periods. The initiative is backed by over 20 million euros in investments and additional funding from the REPowerEU program, with expectations of reducing CO2 emissions by over 900 tons annually. The role of battery storage in the energy market is anticipated to grow, providing flexibility and reliability in electricity supply.",
