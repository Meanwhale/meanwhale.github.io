    "news_text": "US President Donald Trump has imposed new conditions on financial and military aid to Ukraine, stating that support will continue only if the US gains access to Ukraine&#x27;s vast reserves of industrial minerals and energy-critical elements. Ukraine has shown willingness to trade these resources for Western support, as outlined by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his &#x27;victory plan.&#x27; Ukraine&#x27;s rich natural resources, including titanium and lithium, are crucial for modern technology and weapons manufacturing. The US and EU aim to reduce dependency on China for these materials, with Ukraine identified as a potential key supplier. However, the ongoing war with Russia poses significant challenges to exploiting these resources.",
