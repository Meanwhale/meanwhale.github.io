    "news_original_title": "Niger&#x27;s ICRC ban sends shock waves, raises questions",
    "news_text": "Niger&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Ministry announced an unexpected ban on the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), closing its operations in the country. This decision came without warning and coincided with the publication of the ICRC&#x27;s latest humanitarian report. Many foreign staff have left Niger, and the government has not provided an official reason for the closure. Some local experts suggest that the ban may relate to the ICRC&#x27;s activities not aligning with the government&#x27;s interests. The situation reflects a broader trend in the region where NGOs face expulsion without explanation, amid ongoing humanitarian crises exacerbated by sanctions and military conflicts.",
