    "news_text": "The article outlines the evolution of genetic engineering from ancient cross-breeding to modern gene editing, which allows precise DNA modifications in crops and animals. While supporters argue that gene editing can enhance productivity and reduce animal suffering, opponents express safety concerns and potential negative impacts on animal welfare. In the UK, the implementation of the Precision Breeding Act has been stalled, prompting fears of falling behind other countries. The EU maintains strict regulations on genetically modified organisms, complicating the landscape for gene-edited foods. Experts emphasize the need for ethical oversight and strong regulations to ensure the technology benefits both farmers and consumers, while also addressing environmental challenges.",
