    "news_text": "The UK government has announced it will invest over \u00a32.6 billion over the next two years to enhance flood protection for homes and businesses in England, which is \u00a3250 million more than previously disclosed. This funding will support various projects, including tidal barriers and nature-based solutions. Currently, 6.3 million homes are at risk of flooding, a figure that could rise to eight million by 2050 due to climate change. The Environment Secretary criticized the previous government's handling of flood defenses, while a shadow minister defended past investments. Nearly 1,000 projects will benefit from this funding, improving protection for over 66,000 vulnerable properties.",
