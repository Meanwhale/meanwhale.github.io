    "news_text": "Ron Ely, best known for portraying Tarzan in the 1960s television series, passed away at the age of 86 on September 29 at his home in Los Alamos, California. His daughter, Kirsten Casale, confirmed the news on social media. Ely's role in the NBC series from 1966 to 1968 helped shape a modern image of the character originally created by Edgar Rice Burroughs. He performed his own stunts, which led to several injuries. Besides Tarzan, Ely appeared in films like Doc Savage: The Man Of Bronze and Expecting Amish, and had guest roles in various TV series. He also hosted the Miss America pageant in 1980 and 1981. Ely is survived by his wife Valerie and their three children.",
