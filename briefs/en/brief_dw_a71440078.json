    "news_text": "A US judge intervened just before President Trump's plan to halt federal grants and loans was to take effect. The Trump administration aimed to pause these funds to ensure compliance with executive orders, impacting education, healthcare, and other vital programs. The White House stated that the freeze was temporary and not a complete stop on spending. However, New York's Attorney General announced plans to sue over the move, as many states faced disruptions in Medicaid systems. Nonprofits also filed lawsuits against the funding freeze, arguing it lacked legal justification and would harm numerous grant recipients. Critics, including Democratic leaders, condemned the freeze as detrimental to working Americans and a violation of congressional authority.",
