    "news_text": "A new report reveals that the area affected by extreme drought has tripled since the 1980s, with 48% of Earth's land experiencing at least one month of extreme drought in 2022. In 2023, 30% of the world faced extreme drought for three months or longer. The study highlights the accelerating impact of climate change on drought patterns, particularly in South America, the Middle East, and the Horn of Africa. The report also links rising temperatures and increased rainfall to health issues, food insecurity, and water scarcity, emphasizing the urgent need to address greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate these effects.",
