    "news_text": "Nick Read, the outgoing CEO of the Post Office, stated that the leadership was 'part in denial, part in paralysis' regarding the issues with the Horizon IT system when he joined in 2019. He emphasized that the focus was primarily on financial performance rather than the severity of the Horizon scandal, which led to the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of sub-postmasters between 1999 and 2015. Read noted that after a High Court ruling revealed significant defects in the Horizon software, there was a lack of urgent discussions among senior leaders. He acknowledged that it was impossible not to conclude that they were 'living in something of a dream world.' In 2019, the Post Office agreed to pay \u00a358 million in compensation to 555 sub-postmasters, although much of this went to legal fees. Read is set to step down next year and will focus on the ongoing inquiry into the scandal.",
