    "news_text": "SpaceX has reached a significant milestone by catching its rocket booster with its launch tower during a controlled landing back on Earth. This achievement is pivotal for SpaceX's aim to create a reusable launch system for its Starship transport, which could help reduce space debris. Elon Musk expressed hopes of catching the ship as well in the near future. Meanwhile, NASA's Europa Clipper has launched towards Jupiter's moon Europa to gather data about its potential subsurface ocean, while the European Space Agency's Hera mission targets the asteroid Dimorphos for inspection. Additionally, the sun is currently at its maximum activity level, posing potential risks to technology on Earth and in orbit, although astronauts remain safe from solar particles.",
