    "news_text": "SpaceX has reached a significant milestone by catching its rocket booster with its launch tower as it landed back on Earth, a step towards developing a reusable space launch system for its Starship transport. Elon Musk expressed hopes to catch the ship as well in the near future. This achievement aims to reduce space debris, which currently includes around 36,860 objects in orbit that pose risks to the International Space Station and satellites. Meanwhile, NASA's Europa Clipper has launched to study Jupiter's moon Europa, and the European Space Agency's Hera mission targets the asteroid Dimorphos. Additionally, the sun is at its peak activity level, which poses risks to technology on Earth and in orbit, although astronauts are generally safe.",
