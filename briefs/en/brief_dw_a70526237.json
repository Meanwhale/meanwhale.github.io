    "news_text": "SpaceX has reached a significant milestone by catching its rocket booster with a launch tower during its return to Earth, a step towards developing a reusable launch system for its Starship transport. Elon Musk expressed hopes to catch the ship in the future. This achievement aims to minimize space debris, which currently includes around 36,860 objects in orbit, posing risks to the International Space Station and satellites. In related news, NASA's Europa Clipper was launched to study Jupiter's moon Europa, while the European Space Agency's Hera mission targets the asteroid Dimorphos. Additionally, the sun is at its solar maximum, increasing solar activity, which poses potential risks to technology but is generally harmless to astronauts in orbit.",
