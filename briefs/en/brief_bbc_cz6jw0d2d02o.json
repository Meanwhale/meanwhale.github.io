    "news_text": "Rachel Reeves is set to present a budget without the usual fanfare, marking her as the first woman to do so outside Number 11. This budget is expected to be a stark contrast to the controversial mini-Budget from Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng, which disregarded the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR). The OBR has now conducted a thorough audit of Reeves' proposed tax and spending measures, highlighting a \u00a322bn deficit inherited from the previous government. Business leaders express concern over prolonged uncertainty, though they are prepared for tax increases. The budget will include significant tax rises, particularly in National Insurance Contributions, despite Labour's election promises. Reeves aims to address the underfunding of public services while introducing new fiscal rules that will govern future spending and borrowing. The budget is anticipated to provoke mixed reactions, with wealthier taxpayers likely facing anger while public service users may find relief. Overall, this budget is positioned as a long-term strategy for economic stability and investment.",
