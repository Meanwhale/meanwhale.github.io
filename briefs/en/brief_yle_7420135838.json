    "news_text": "Valio has renewed its infant milk substitute exports to China, which began in 2019 but were paused in 2023 due to stricter licensing requirements. The company produces infant formula in Finland, with the powder made in North Savo and liquid substitutes in Janakkala. After re-registration and compliance with Chinese regulations, exports resumed in late 2024. China's tightened regulations have reduced the number of infant formula manufacturers, with 70% of the market now being Chinese products.",
