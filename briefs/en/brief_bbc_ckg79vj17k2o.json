    "news_text": "A House of Lords committee has deemed the government&#x27;s plan to re-designate green belt land as grey belt for housing development as largely redundant. The committee believes that the grey belt concept has been overshadowed by more significant government changes. The Labour government aims to build 1.5 million homes in five years, identifying &#x27;poor quality&#x27; green belt land for potential development. However, the committee expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of the grey belt in meeting housing targets, noting that estimates for potential dwellings on grey belt land vary widely. The impact of the new planning policies will clarify the role of grey belt in housing development.",
