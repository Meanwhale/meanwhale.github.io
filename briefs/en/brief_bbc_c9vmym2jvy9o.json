    "news_text": "US President-elect Donald Trump has introduced a new cryptocurrency, $Trump, which rapidly reached a market capitalization of approximately $5.5 billion shortly after its launch. Coordinated by CIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of the Trump Organization, the meme coin aims to capitalize on internet trends but lacks intrinsic value and is highly volatile. Critics have raised concerns about the timing of the launch just before Trump's inauguration, suggesting it could exploit investors. The coin's website clarifies that it is not intended as an investment opportunity. Trump's past skepticism about cryptocurrency has shifted, and he has expressed ambitions for the US to become a leader in the crypto industry.",
