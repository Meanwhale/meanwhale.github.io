    "news_text": "Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, emphasized the importance of US support for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. He expressed concern over potential changes in support from the Trump administration, especially following a White House executive order reviewing international organizations. Bailey warned against fragmentation of the world economy and highlighted the critical role of these institutions in maintaining global economic stability. There are fears that the US may withdraw from these organizations, as suggested in the 'Project 2025' blueprint, which advocates for a reevaluation of the US's involvement based on perceived conflicts with American principles.",
