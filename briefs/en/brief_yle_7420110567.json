    "news_text": "In Finland, individuals can donate their bodies to science for the training of future doctors at universities such as Helsinki, Turku, Tampere, and Eastern Finland. Editor Noora Takam\u00e4ki outlines the donation process, eligibility criteria, and the storage of donated bodies. The bodies are primarily used for the study of human anatomy and not for treatment development. The popularity of body donations has risen, with around 140 donations last year. However, certain conditions, like infectious diseases or prior autopsies, can disqualify a body. It's important to note that bodies cannot be collected on weekends, and the learning process can take up to a year. After use, bodies are cremated, and ashes can be buried if desired.",
