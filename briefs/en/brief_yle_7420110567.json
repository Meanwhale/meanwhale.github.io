    "news_text": "Editor Noora Takam\u00e4ki explains the process of body donation for scientific purposes in Finland, including eligibility, storage, and the procedures involved. Bodies are used primarily for anatomical studies at universities such as Helsinki, Turku, Tampere, and Eastern Finland. The number of donations has risen, with around 140 people donating last year. However, certain conditions like infectious diseases or prior autopsies can disqualify a body. Timing is crucial, as bodies must be collected promptly after death. After educational use, bodies are cremated, and ashes can be buried if requested.",
