    "news_text": "Thailand's government has set a target to welcome 40 million visitors by 2025 as part of efforts to rejuvenate the tourism sector affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The strategy includes promoting lesser-known destinations, expanding flight capacity, and enhancing the experience of Thai culture. Tourism analyst Gary Bowerman emphasizes the importance of increasing visitor spending and length of stay rather than just focusing on arrival numbers. The Chinese market plays a crucial role in tourism, but changing travel patterns may affect visitor numbers. To manage potential overtourism, proposals such as a tourism tax have been discussed. Experts suggest that tourism should be distributed more evenly across the country to benefit all regions.",
