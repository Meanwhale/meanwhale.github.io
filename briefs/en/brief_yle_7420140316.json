    "news_text": "Asteroid 2024 YR4, discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, measures 40 to 100 meters in diameter and poses a potential threat to Earth, with a chance of impact estimated at 1.2%. While it is not large enough to cause global extinction, it could destroy a major city. The asteroid will come close to Earth several times in the coming decades, with the highest risk of impact on December 22, 2032. NASA is monitoring the situation, as the asteroid is currently rated a level 3 on the Turin Impact Hazard Scale. Efforts to mitigate asteroid threats have been ongoing, including NASA's successful DART mission, which altered the orbit of the Dimorphos moon.",
