    "news_header": "Bangladesh's interim government has reversed a ban on the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami, previously imposed by Sheikh Hasina's government, as it seeks to restore political rights and prepare for new elections.",
    "news_text": "The interim government of Bangladesh, led by Muhammed Yunus, has lifted the ban on Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), which was enforced by the former Awami League government under Sheikh Hasina, who accused the party of terrorism. The interim administration aims to create a fair political environment and restore citizens' voting rights. While some experts argue that the ban was justified due to JI's historical ties with Pakistan during the 1971 liberation war, others believe the party should be allowed to adapt and participate in politics. The interim government has also banned the Awami League's student wing, the Bangladesh Chhatra League, labeling it a terrorist organization, a move criticized for lacking legal and constitutional grounds. There are concerns about the release of convicted terrorists and the overall transparency of the interim government's actions.",
