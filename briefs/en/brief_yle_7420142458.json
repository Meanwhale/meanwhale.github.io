    "news_text": "A compromise proposal has been put forward by the national mediator regarding a work dispute involving workers in the technology industry. The Industry Union and employers are expected to respond by Sunday at 6:00 p.m. If the proposal is accepted, the planned strikes by the Industry Association will be canceled. The Industry Union has been striking to expedite negotiations, and a new five-day strike will begin on Monday if no agreement is reached. The Industry Union has been negotiating a collective agreement for five months, with previous mediation attempts having been made nine times. The Association of Industry is seeking a 10% wage increase over two years, citing a decline in purchasing power, while employers argue that such increases could harm competitiveness and employment.",
