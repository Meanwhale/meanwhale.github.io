    "news_text": "The archaeological ruins of Ravatula Church, discovered in 2013, are the oldest known church site in Finland, dating back to the 12th century. They provide evidence of the gradual introduction of Christianity to Finland, contradicting earlier beliefs that it was brought violently through crusades. Archaeologist Juha Ruohonen highlights that the establishment of local churches occurred earlier than previously thought, and the findings from the site, including graves and textiles, offer new insights into early Finnish history and culture. Excavations revealed that while Christian burial practices were adopted, old traditions persisted. The research continues to evolve, promising further discoveries.",
