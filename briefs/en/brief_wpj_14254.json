    "news_text": "A study by Clever Real Estate reveals that 86% of agents believe recent commission structure changes, following a DOJ lawsuit against the National Association of Realtors, will drive many out of the industry. The key change shifts the responsibility of paying the buyer's agent's commission from sellers to buyers. Nearly half of agents feel pessimistic about their career prospects, and 72% predict negative industry impacts. While 66% of agents think buyers will use agents less, only 22% of buyers agree. Interestingly, 67% of homeowners support the changes, although many lack a strong understanding of the lawsuit. Most homeowners and buyers want agents to disclose commission rates upfront and support government regulation of these rates. Amid these changes, 83% of agents plan to adapt their business strategies.",
