    "news_text": "Magnus Ericsson, a mining expert, argues that U.S. demands for $500 billion worth of minerals from Ukraine are unrealistic. He points out that Ukraine lacks significant deposits of rare earth metals, which are crucial to the U.S. plan. While Ukraine is a major mining country, producing iron ore, titanium, and manganese, the idea of cooperation in mineral production originated from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. U.S. Finance Minister Scott Bessent emphasizes that the proceeds from these resources would support Ukraine&#x27;s reconstruction. However, Zelensky is not ready to finalize an agreement in its current form. Donald Trump has expressed that he expects something in return for U.S. financial support, including rare earth metals and oil.",
