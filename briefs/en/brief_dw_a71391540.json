    "news_text": "On December 18, Brazil&#x27;s currency, the real, plummeted by 2.8% to a record low of 6.2 reals per dollar, reflecting a significant annual depreciation. Despite interventions by the central bank, the real&#x27;s decline raises concerns about inflation and the economy&#x27;s structural issues. The national minimum wage has dropped significantly, and national debt is rising, nearing historical highs. Lula&#x27;s government announced spending cuts and tax reductions, but many view these measures as inadequate. Inflation is affecting ordinary Brazilians, contributing to Lula&#x27;s declining approval ratings amid a scandal involving social benefit misuse for gambling.",
