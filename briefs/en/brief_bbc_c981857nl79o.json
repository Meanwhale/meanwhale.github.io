    "news_text": "In September, UK government borrowing rose to \u00a316.6bn, marking the third-highest level since records began in 1993. This figure, which exceeds official forecasts, presents challenges for the Treasury as it prepares for the Budget on October 30, where it plans not to borrow for day-to-day spending. The government may revise its fiscal rules to allow more investment in infrastructure. Chief Treasury Secretary Darren Jones indicated that the new Labour government faces a fiscal 'black hole' requiring tough decisions, with potential tax increases or spending cuts anticipated. The increase in borrowing is attributed to higher debt interest and public sector pay rises, while social benefits decreased. The national debt reached 98.5% of economic output, reflecting ongoing financial challenges.",
