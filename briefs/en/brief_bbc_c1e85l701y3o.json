    "news_text": "Last Thursday, a 13-year-old boy was apprehended for shooting outside the offices of Israeli tech company Elbit Systems in Gothenburg, leading to investigations for attempted murder and weapons offenses. This incident is part of a troubling trend of violence involving young teenagers in Sweden, often linked to gang conflicts and foreign influence, particularly from Iran. Recent attacks on Israeli embassies in Sweden and Denmark have raised concerns about the involvement of Iranian-backed criminal networks. The ongoing gang violence in Sweden has escalated, with criminal organizations like Foxtrot and Rumba engaging in violent feuds, drawing in teenagers as perpetrators. Experts highlight a shift in the demographics of gang members, with increasing involvement from ethnic Swedes, and a worrying trend of youth being drawn into a 'gang gig-economy.' Swedish authorities are grappling with the implications of this violence on national security.",
