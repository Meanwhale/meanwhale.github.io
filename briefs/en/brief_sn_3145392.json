    "news_text": "Research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association indicates that electric fans are ineffective in reducing core body temperatures in older adults during extreme heat conditions. A study involving 18 participants aged 65 to 72 found no significant changes in core temperature or thermal comfort when using fans, especially at ambient temperatures above 33\u00b0C (91\u00b0F). The study highlights the risks older adults face during heat waves, particularly when lacking air conditioning, and suggests that traditional fan use may not provide the expected relief.",
