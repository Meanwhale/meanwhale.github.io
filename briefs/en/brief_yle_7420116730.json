    "news_text": "Benjamin Netanyahu stated in a video message to the Lebanese people that Israel has eliminated three Hezbollah leaders in succession, including the successor to Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in September. He urged Lebanese citizens to free themselves from Hezbollah to end the war. It remains unclear which specific leaders Netanyahu is referring to, although Israel's Defense Minister suggested that Hashem Safieddine, Nasrallah's alleged successor, likely died in an Israeli airstrike last week. Netanyahu warned that Lebanon is now a place of chaos and war due to 'tyrants and terrorists' and could face a fate similar to Gaza unless action is taken to prevent long-term suffering. Hezbollah has not confirmed the deaths of Safieddine or the other leaders mentioned by Netanyahu.",
