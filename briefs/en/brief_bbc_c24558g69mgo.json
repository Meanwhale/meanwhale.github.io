    "news_text": "A recent assessment indicates that 38% of the world's tree species are threatened with extinction, a figure that exceeds the combined threats to all birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. This alarming news was announced during the UN biodiversity summit, COP 16, in Cali, Colombia. The assessment involved over 1,000 scientists and highlighted that trees are crucial for air quality and carbon absorption, as well as providing habitats for various species. Major threats to trees include land clearing for agriculture and logging, with pests and diseases also posing risks in temperate regions. Notable species at risk include magnolias, oaks, and maples. The update to the extinction red list also reported concerning news for other species, including the hedgehog and several migratory shorebirds in the UK. The summit aims to evaluate progress on protecting 30% of global lands and waters by 2030, with ongoing discussions about biodiversity financing and national conservation plans.",
