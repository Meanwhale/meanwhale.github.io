    "news_text": "US President Donald Trump renewed his criticism of the Federal Reserve after it decided to keep interest rates unchanged. He accused the Fed and its chairman Jerome Powell of failing to address inflation issues. The Fed maintained rates between 4.25% and 4.5%, citing economic uncertainty. Trump has proposed significant economic changes, including tariffs and tax cuts, which some economists warn could increase prices. Powell emphasized the Fed's focus on data and the need to remain independent from political influence, despite challenges posed by the White House's orders on diversity programs.",
