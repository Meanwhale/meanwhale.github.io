    "news_text": "President Trump has quickly signed an executive order that undermines a global corporate minimum tax agreement supported by former President Biden and nearly 150 countries. The order states that the agreement has no effect in the US without Congressional action, aiming to protect American companies from foreign tax practices. The OECD-backed deal includes a global minimum tax of 15% for large multinational corporations and a provision to tax profits where they are earned. The lack of US participation raises concerns about the deal's viability, as many targeted companies are American. The situation may lead to unilateral tax regulations by various countries, increasing competition and potential chaos in international tax policy.",
