    "news_text": "Newly inaugurated President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that disrupts the global corporate minimum tax agreement, initially supported by former President Joe Biden and nearly 150 countries. The order states that the agreement has no effect in the U.S. without Congressional action, emphasizing the need to maintain U.S. sovereignty and competitiveness against foreign tax practices. The OECD-backed deal aimed to ensure that large multinational corporations pay a minimum tax of 15% on profits, but Trump's withdrawal raises concerns about the deal's viability, especially for American companies. This move has been met with criticism, as it may lead to unilateral tax regulations and increased competition among countries.",
