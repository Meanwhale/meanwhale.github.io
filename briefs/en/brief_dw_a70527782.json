    "news_text": "Voters in Moldova are set to participate in a referendum on Sunday to decide if the constitution should be amended to include joining the European Union as a strategic objective. This historic vote involves 228 polling stations across 37 counties and follows Moldova's official negotiations to join the EU, which began in June. President Maia Sandu's pro-West government aims to solidify EU accession efforts against potential future backtracking by leaders. The referendum's success hinges on a majority 'yes' vote with at least 33% turnout. However, the process is fraught with challenges, including accusations of Russian interference and bribery attempts to sway voters. Recent polls indicate a divided public opinion on EU membership, with a narrow margin expected in the referendum outcome. The situation is further complicated by Moldova's geopolitical position between the EU and Russia, as well as internal political dynamics involving pro-Russian parties.",
