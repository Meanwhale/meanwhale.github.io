    "news_text": "Boeing announced it has withdrawn its pay rise offer to striking workers after negotiations with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) reached a stalemate. The company accused the union of not seriously considering its proposals, while the union claimed Boeing was unwilling to negotiate. Boeing's last offer included a 30% pay rise over four years, which was lower than the 40% demanded by the union. Over 30,000 Boeing workers went on strike after rejecting a previous deal, resulting in the suspension of jobs for tens of thousands of staff and potential significant financial losses for the company. The strike adds to the challenges faced by Boeing's new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, amid ongoing production and quality concerns.",
