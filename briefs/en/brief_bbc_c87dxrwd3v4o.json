    "news_text": "The pound has shown signs of stabilizing after a turbulent period, rising early on Tuesday but falling back below $1.22. UK government borrowing costs have dipped slightly but remain at their highest levels since 2008. Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces scrutiny from the Conservatives, who accuse her of failing to address financial market issues. The yield on the 10-year gilt has dropped marginally to 4.87%, while the 30-year gilt yield edged down to 5.42%. Experts suggest that the UK's specific problems stem from a delayed response to heavy tax and spending decisions made in last year's Budget, which may lead to inflation.",
