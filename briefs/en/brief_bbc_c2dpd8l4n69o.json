    "news_text": "On October 1, Claudia Sheinbaum succeeded Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador as Mexico's president, inheriting a mixed economic landscape. While Mexico has strengthened its trade ties with the US, overtaking China as its largest trading partner due to 'nearshoring', it faces challenges, particularly with the heavily indebted state oil company Pemex, which has around $100 billion in debt. Critics argue that the relocation of manufacturing to Mexico may not benefit the local economy. Sheinbaum must navigate Pemex's financial issues while also addressing climate change and maintaining relations with the US amid upcoming trade negotiations. Despite these challenges, she enjoys strong support and aims to continue L\u00f3pez Obrador's social programs.",
