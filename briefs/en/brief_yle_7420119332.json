    "news_text": "Scientists have discovered that the S2 meteorite, which struck Earth around three billion years ago, was significantly larger than the one that caused the extinction of dinosaurs. Measuring 40-60 kilometers wide and weighing 200 times more than the dinosaur-killing meteorite, it created a massive 500-kilometer wide crater and triggered a giant tsunami. Initially believed to have caused widespread destruction of life, recent research from Harvard University suggests that the impact may have actually contributed to the conditions necessary for new life to emerge. The impact released essential nutrients like phosphorus and iron from underground, akin to fertilizing the Earth, which helped support the development of new life forms in a predominantly aquatic environment filled with single-celled organisms.",
