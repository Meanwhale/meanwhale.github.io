    "news_text": "Scientists have discovered that the S2 meteorite, which struck Earth around three billion years ago, was significantly larger than the one that caused the extinction of dinosaurs, weighing 200 times more and creating a 500-kilometer wide crater. Initially believed to have caused widespread destruction of life, recent research from Harvard University suggests that the impact may have actually contributed to the development of new life by releasing essential nutrients like phosphorus and iron from underground sources. This event, occurring when Earth was mostly covered by oceans and inhabited by single-celled organisms, may have set the stage for future life forms.",
