    "news_text": "Scientists have discovered that the S2 meteorite, which struck Earth around three billion years ago, was significantly larger than the one that led to the extinction of dinosaurs. Measuring 40-60 kilometers wide and weighing 200 times more than the dinosaur-killing meteorite, S2 created a massive 500-kilometer wide crater and triggered a giant tsunami. The impact darkened the sky and raised air temperatures by 100 degrees, leading to the evaporation of seawater. Initially thought to have caused widespread destruction of life, recent research from Harvard University suggests that the impact may have actually fostered conditions for new life by releasing essential nutrients like phosphorus and iron from underground. This process is likened to fertilizing the Earth, enabling the emergence of new life forms.",
