    "news_text": "US government employees were asked to report their accomplishments from the past week or resign, as part of the Trump administration&#x27;s efforts to reduce the federal workforce. This email, sent by the Office of Personnel Management, followed Elon Musk&#x27;s comments about evaluating employee productivity. The American Federation of Government Employees criticized the request as disrespectful, while some agency heads advised employees to pause responses. Musk claimed that many government employees were not doing enough work and suggested that fraud was occurring. Trump supported these measures, emphasizing the need for a smaller, more efficient government. This approach mirrors Musk&#x27;s management style at Twitter, where he also issued ultimatums to employees.",
