    "news_text": "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has confirmed the deployment of North Korean troops in Russia's Kursk border region, following intelligence reports and discussions with South Korean officials. This marks the first formal acknowledgment by NATO of North Korean forces in Russia, which Rutte described as a significant escalation of the conflict in Ukraine. Reports suggest that at least 1,500 North Korean soldiers have already arrived, with estimates of up to 5,000 elite troops potentially joining. The partnership between North Korea and Russia, which includes military support and technology exchanges, is seen as undermining global peace. The situation raises concerns in Western capitals, especially as fighting continues between Russian and Ukrainian forces. The involvement of North Korean troops could further complicate the conflict, as experts question their effectiveness due to a lack of recent combat experience.",
