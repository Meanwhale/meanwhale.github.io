With US sales accounting for 60-70% of its turnover, the company has been proactive since before the US presidential election. If Trump&#x27;s proposed 10% tariff on the EU is enacted, it could raise costs for US customers. However, CSE is focused on maintaining competitiveness and has seen growth in over 65 countries, expecting a 30-40% increase in European turnover this year. The company remains optimistic despite potential trade wars.",
