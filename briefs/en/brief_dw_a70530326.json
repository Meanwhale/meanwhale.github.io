    "news_text": "During a recent rally in Georgia, Donald Trump reiterated his commitment to American manufacturing, promising lower taxes and energy costs for foreign automakers that increase production in the US. However, he also threatened 'very substantial tariffs' on vehicles not made in the US, reminiscent of his 2016 campaign promises. Automotive analysts express skepticism about the feasibility of Trump's plans, particularly regarding German automakers who have invested heavily in US production to avoid previous tariffs. Concerns arise over Trump's intention to roll back electric vehicle subsidies, which could disrupt the supply chain for combustion-engine vehicles. Additionally, German manufacturers in Mexico face potential tariffs and challenges due to a skills gap in the US labor market. Despite these challenges, analysts believe that while German car brands will face difficulties, they are unlikely to be written off due to their profitability and brand strength.",
