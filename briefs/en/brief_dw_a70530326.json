    "news_text": "At a rally in Georgia, Donald Trump reiterated his desire for foreign automakers, particularly German companies, to increase production in the U.S., promising low taxes and reduced regulations. He threatened 'very substantial tariffs' on vehicles not made in the U.S., reminiscent of his 2016 campaign. Analysts express skepticism about the feasibility of his plans, noting that German automakers have previously avoided tariffs through investment in U.S. production. However, Trump's potential rollback of electric vehicle subsidies could disrupt the supply chain for both German and other automakers. The German automotive industry, heavily integrated with Mexico for production, faces challenges from Trump's protectionist policies and a skills gap in the U.S. market. Despite these hurdles, experts believe German brands will remain profitable but may downsize significantly.",
