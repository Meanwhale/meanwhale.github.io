    "news_text": "The connection between Bitcoin and Donald Trump's support lies in young men. Following Trump's election, there was a surge in interest in cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin's value expected to rise significantly. Analysts suggest that Trump's presidency could enhance the credibility of cryptocurrencies. Trump's previous skepticism towards cryptocurrencies has shifted, influenced by supporters like Elon Musk. He proposes that the U.S. should hold Bitcoin as a strategic reserve and aims to remove regulatory barriers. Despite the optimism, Bitcoin remains a high-risk investment, with limited everyday use in Finland. The allure of quick wealth appeals to young men, making the crypto market a popular space for them.",
