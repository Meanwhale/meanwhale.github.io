    "news_text": "In northeast Iceland, near the Krafla volcano, a team led by Bjorn Por Gu\u00f0mundsson plans to drill into the magma as part of the Krafla Magma Testbed (KMT) project, starting in 2026. This initiative aims to improve understanding of underground magma behavior, which could enhance eruption forecasting and geothermal energy extraction. The project will involve drilling two boreholes to create an underground magma observatory, with the first borehole reaching approximately 2.1 km deep. Researchers hope to instrument the magma with pressure and temperature sensors to better predict volcanic activity, potentially benefiting the 800 million people living near active volcanoes worldwide. The KMT project also aims to develop a new generation of geothermal power stations that utilize magma's extreme heat, which could significantly increase energy production. Despite the challenges of drilling in such extreme conditions, experts believe the project could transform geothermal energy and improve safety measures against volcanic eruptions.",
