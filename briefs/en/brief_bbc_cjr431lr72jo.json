    "news_text": "In June 2006, Shivaun and Adam Raff launched Foundem, a price comparison website, only to face a Google search penalty that severely limited their visibility and revenue. Despite their efforts to rectify the situation, including multiple requests to Google, they received no response. This led to a lengthy legal battle against Google, culminating in a \u20ac2.4bn fine in 2017 for abusing market dominance. The couple's case highlighted systemic issues with Google's practices, prompting further investigations under the Digital Markets Act. Although they pursued civil damages, they ultimately closed Foundem in 2016, reflecting on the toll of their prolonged fight against the tech giant.",
