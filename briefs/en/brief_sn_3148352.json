    "news_text": "On Bylot Island in the Canadian Arctic, researchers uncovered glacier ice that could be over a million years old, potentially the oldest ever found in permafrost. The discovery, reported in Geology, offers a rare opportunity to study early Pleistocene climate changes. The ice, revealed by recent landslides due to thawing permafrost, contains gas bubbles and particulates that can inform scientists about ancient atmospheres. Despite climate change threatening permafrost, the resilience of this ancient glacier suggests it has survived through warmer interglacial periods.",
