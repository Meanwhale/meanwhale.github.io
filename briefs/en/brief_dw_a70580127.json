    "news_text": "Martin Hibbert and his daughter Eve, survivors of the 2017 suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert, successfully sued Richard Hall for harassment and data protection breaches after he falsely claimed the attack was staged. The court, led by Judge Karen Steyn, condemned Hall's actions as a reckless abuse of media freedom for commercial gain, emphasizing the harm caused to the Hibberts. A hearing on November 8 will determine if they receive an injunction and damages. Martin Hibbert expressed hope for change to protect others from similar harassment in the future.",
