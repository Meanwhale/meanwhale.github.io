    "news_header": "A British court ruled in favor of Martin Hibbert and his daughter Eve, survivors of the 2017 Manchester attack, against Richard Hall, who claimed the attack was a hoax.",
    "news_text": "The court found that Richard Hall's claims about the 2017 suicide attack at an Ariana Grande concert were false and harassing towards the Hibberts, who were severely injured in the attack. Judge Karen Steyn criticized Hall for abusing media freedom for commercial gain and described his actions as reckless. A decision on whether the Hibberts will receive an injunction and damages is pending. Martin Hibbert called the ruling a 'comprehensive victory' and expressed hope for future protections against similar harassment.",
