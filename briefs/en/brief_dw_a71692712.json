    "news_original_title": "End of an era? Europe&#x27;s shaky security strategy for Ukraine",
    "news_text": "The US, under President Trump, appears to be distancing itself from Ukraine and European allies, raising fears about security in Europe. Trump&#x27;s recent comments and actions suggest he is pushing Ukraine to accept unfavorable terms to end the war, including territorial concessions and a lack of NATO membership. European leaders are alarmed, fearing that a US disengagement could embolden Russia to attack other European nations. The EU is now contemplating its own defense strategies, including the possibility of deploying troops to Ukraine, while key countries like Germany remain uncertain about their commitments. The situation is further complicated by upcoming German elections, which could shift the country&#x27;s stance on Ukraine policy. Experts warn that the current dynamics may lead to a significant change in the European security landscape.",
