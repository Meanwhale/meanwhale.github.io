    "news_header": "Donald Trump plans to impose tariffs on all imported goods if he regains the presidency, raising concerns among businesses and economists about global price impacts.",
    "news_text": "Donald Trump has pledged to tax all imported goods by 10% to 20% if he wins back the White House, which could significantly affect global prices. His previous tariffs targeted specific countries and industries, but this broader approach has raised alarms, especially in Europe, where car manufacturers like BMW and Mercedes saw stock declines post-election. The EU is preparing retaliatory measures, and a potential trade war could impact the global economy significantly. The UK faces challenges in navigating its position in this scenario, especially post-Brexit, as it balances relationships with both the US and the EU.",
