    "news_text": "Investors often rely on Wall Street analysts&#x27; recommendations before making stock decisions. Netflix currently has an average brokerage recommendation of 1.68, indicating a strong buy. However, studies show that brokerage recommendations may not be reliable due to analysts&#x27; biases influenced by their firms&#x27; interests. The Zacks Rank, which uses earnings estimate revisions, is suggested as a more reliable tool for predicting stock performance. Despite the favorable ABR for Netflix, investors should validate their own research before making decisions.",
