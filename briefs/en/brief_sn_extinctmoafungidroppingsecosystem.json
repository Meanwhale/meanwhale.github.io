    "news_text": "Research on ancient DNA from the droppings of extinct moa birds in New Zealand has identified various fungi species they consumed, including a purple truffle-like fungus. This discovery highlights the role of these birds in dispersing fungi, which are essential for forest health. The study suggests that without moa, New Zealand&#x27;s forests may lack resilience due to the absence of these fungi, which play a critical role in nutrient uptake and ecosystem balance.",
