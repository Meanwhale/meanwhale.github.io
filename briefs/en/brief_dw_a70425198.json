    "news_text": "Volkswagen's management has announced the potential closure of one or two car plants in Germany and significant job cuts due to declining sales, which has raised concerns among its 120,000 employees. This situation comes just before collective bargaining talks, where workers anticipated wage increases. The company, despite posting over \u20ac18 billion in profits in 2023, is facing challenges from rising production costs and competition from Chinese manufacturers, particularly in the electric vehicle market. The German automotive industry is struggling with overcapacity, and high labor costs compared to other countries. Additionally, European carmakers are at risk of incurring substantial fines for not meeting EU climate goals. Amid these challenges, VW management is under pressure from employees demanding wage increases and job security.",
