    "news_text": "Volkswagen (VW) is set to shut down at least three factories in Germany and lay off tens of thousands of workers as part of a cost-cutting plan, according to Daniela Cavallo, head of the company's works council. This marks a significant shift for VW, which has not considered plant closures in Germany during its 87-year history. The company faces challenges from high energy and labor costs, increased competition from Asian manufacturers, and a slower transition to electric vehicles (EVs). Despite posting profits of over \u20ac18 billion in 2023, VW management has initiated an efficiency program aimed at saving \u20ac10 billion by 2026 due to declining sales and overcapacity issues in German factories. The situation is compounded by the high production costs in Germany compared to other countries, making it difficult to produce affordable vehicles, especially EVs. As VW management negotiates with unions, employees are demanding wage increases and job security amidst these changes.",
