    "news_header": "The Knesset is set to vote on bills that would effectively ban UNRWA from operating in Israel, following allegations of its staff's involvement in recent terror attacks, which could severely impact humanitarian aid in Gaza and the West Bank.",
    "news_text": "The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) faces existential threats due to chronic underfunding and accusations from Israeli officials regarding its role in Palestinian displacement. This week, Knesset lawmakers plan to vote on two bills that would prohibit UNRWA's operations in Israeli territory, including East Jerusalem, following allegations that some agency staff were involved in the October 7, 2023, terror attacks. The proposed legislation, backed by right-wing parties, would revoke the 1967 agreement allowing UNRWA to operate in Israel, effectively closing its headquarters in East Jerusalem and halting coordination with Israeli authorities, which is crucial for aid delivery. UNRWA, established in 1949, provides essential services to millions of Palestinian refugees and has faced criticism from Israeli officials for allegedly inciting hatred and perpetuating the conflict. The proposed bills have drawn sharp criticism from UNRWA donor countries and human rights organizations, with concerns that they would violate international law and worsen the humanitarian situation in the region.",
