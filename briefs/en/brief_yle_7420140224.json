    "news_text": "Russia continues to produce icebreakers, whereas the last one in the West was completed nine years ago. New orders could benefit Finland significantly. President Trump's announcement of ordering 40 large icebreakers is deemed unrealistic by Finnish experts. There are trade policy concerns regarding where these icebreakers would be built. In recent years, only one or two icebreakers have been completed globally, primarily in Russia. Finland could potentially build four icebreakers in its shipyards, while the U.S. has one under construction for the first time in 50 years, expected to be completed in the 2030s. The need for new icebreakers has been acknowledged, but specifics are lacking, making it hard to assess the feasibility of Trump's claims. Finland, the U.S., and Canada have agreed to cooperate on icebreaker construction, with a noted need for 70-90 new vessels.",
