    "news_header": "Haiti faces escalating gang violence and humanitarian crises despite international security efforts.",
    "news_text": "Gangs in Haiti have intensified their violent activities and expanded beyond the capital, as warned by Maria Isabel Salvador, the UN's special representative to Haiti. Over 700,000 people are now displaced, marking a 22% increase in three months. The situation has worsened, with gangs spreading terror, overwhelming national security, and worsening humanitarian conditions. Recent gang attacks have resulted in numerous civilian casualties, and incidents of sexual violence have surged. The UN has expressed concerns for children, who make up half of the displaced population and are often targeted by gangs. Despite the UN Security Council's approval for an international security force to assist local police, only a small number of troops have arrived, and funding remains slow. Political instability further complicates the situation, with increasing tensions between the country's dual executive leadership.",
