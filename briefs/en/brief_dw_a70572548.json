    "news_header": "Haiti faces escalating gang violence and humanitarian crises despite international security efforts.",
    "news_text": "Gangs in Haiti have intensified violence and expanded their operations beyond the capital, as reported by Maria Isabel Salvador, the UN's special representative to Haiti. Over 700,000 people are now displaced, marking a 22% increase in three months. The situation has worsened, with gangs spreading terror, committing brutal acts of violence, and overwhelming national security. Recent attacks, including one in Port Sonde that killed 114 civilians, highlight the crisis. The violence has also affected maritime activities and international shipping. Despite the UN Security Council's approval for an international security force, only a small number of troops have arrived. UNICEF reported that children, who make up half of the displaced population, are particularly vulnerable to gang violence and exploitation. Political instability further complicates the situation, with increasing tensions between the country's leadership since the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021.",
