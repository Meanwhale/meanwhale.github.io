    "news_text": "As his presidency nears its end, US President Joe Biden is set to visit Germany on October 18, where he will receive the Federal Cross of Merit, becoming the first US president to be honored with this award since George H. W. Bush. This recognition is for his contributions to US-German friendship and the transatlantic alliance over five decades. Biden's long-standing engagement with Europe, particularly through NATO and his early political experiences during the Cold War, has shaped his foreign policy approach. The US and Germany have collaborated closely on issues like support for Ukraine and shared domestic challenges, including political divides and immigration policies. Analysts suggest that Biden may be the last president to maintain such a strong transatlantic focus, as future US foreign policy is expected to shift towards the Indo-Pacific region, potentially altering the dynamics of the US-German relationship.",
