    "news_text": "GJ 9827d, an exoplanet located about 100 light-years from Earth, has been identified as a 'steam world' due to its atmosphere being predominantly made up of hot water molecules. Discovered in 2017, this sub-Neptune planet is about twice the size and three times the mass of Earth. Observations using the James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope confirmed that the atmosphere is nearly all water vapor, with temperatures around 340\u00b0C. While the high pressure in the atmosphere may prevent the existence of a solid surface and make it unlikely to harbor life, studying GJ 9827d's atmosphere provides valuable insights for future observations of potentially habitable planets.",
