    "news_text": "According to DAFT.ie, housing prices in Ireland increased by an average of 3.1% nationally in the third quarter of 2024, with the typical price reaching \u20ac344,848, a 6.2% rise from the previous year and a 37% increase since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Dublin saw a 4.1% rise, the largest in three months since early 2017, with prices now over 6% higher than last year. Dublin's annual inflation rate has surpassed that of other major cities for the first time since 2020. While Cork, Galway, and Waterford experienced around a 4% increase, Limerick had the highest inflation at 9.7%. The supply of second-hand homes has dropped to a record low, with fewer than 11,900 homes available, marking a 12% decrease from last year. This decline in supply has led to increased prices, particularly in Dublin, where second-hand homes sold for an average of 7.6% above their listed price. Economist Ronan Lyons emphasized the ongoing scarcity of homes as a critical issue for policymakers.",
