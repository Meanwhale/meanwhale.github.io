    "news_text": "In Skellefte\u00e5, Sweden, Northvolt, once set to be Europe's largest electric battery factory, is struggling financially, reporting $5.8 billion in debts and filing for bankruptcy in the U.S. after rapid expansion and missed production targets. The decline in demand for electric vehicles and competition from Chinese manufacturers have contributed to its crisis. The Swedish government has refused to bail out the company, emphasizing market forces, while local businesses express concern over the negative impact on Sweden's green technology reputation. Despite this, there are calls for increased state support to maintain Sweden's position in the clean tech sector.",
