    "news_text": "The BBC has revealed the tactics of a professional shoplifting gang, dubbed the 'champagne gang', which has stolen at least \u00a373,000 worth of goods from supermarkets across the UK. Operating in groups of three, they use Bluetooth headsets for communication and employ distractions to evade security. The gang, which originated from Romania, has been involved in 60 shoplifting incidents nationwide and has adapted their methods in response to new security technologies. They have a structured hierarchy and are believed to be part of a larger network of organized crime groups responsible for significant retail losses. Retailers report that these gangs are becoming increasingly sophisticated, impacting their businesses and contributing to rising costs for consumers. Law enforcement efforts are ongoing, but challenges remain in effectively addressing the issue.",
