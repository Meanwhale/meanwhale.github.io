    "news_header": "Israel has conducted multiple air strikes on Tyre, Lebanon, amid ongoing conflict with Hezbollah, leading to mass evacuations.",
    "news_text": "Israel has executed at least four air strikes on the Lebanese city of Tyre, following expanded evacuation orders for central neighborhoods. The strikes, which targeted areas near UNESCO-listed Roman ruins, resulted in significant smoke but no immediate casualties reported. The Israeli military warned civilians to evacuate as it planned forceful actions against Hezbollah. Many residents had already fled due to ongoing air campaigns, but around 14,000 remained in Tyre. Additionally, Israeli forces targeted Hezbollah positions in Beirut and southern Lebanon, claiming to have killed several Hezbollah commanders and fighters. In retaliation, Hezbollah launched rocket attacks into Israel, prompting alerts in Tel Aviv. The conflict, intensified by the war in Gaza, has resulted in over 2,500 deaths in Lebanon and 59 in northern Israel since October 2023.",
