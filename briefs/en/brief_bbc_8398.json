A public hearing by the US Coast Guard is set to investigate the disaster's causes, including design flaws and safety concerns.",
    "news_text": "The Titan submersible, operated by Oceangate, aimed to take passengers on a deep-sea journey to the Titanic wreck but suffered a catastrophic implosion during a dive on June 18, 2023, resulting in the deaths of all five individuals on board. The US Coast Guard is holding a public hearing to explore the reasons behind the disaster, including the sub's unconventional design, ignored safety warnings, and the absence of regulatory oversight. Key issues identified include the sub's viewport rated for shallower depths, its cylindrical hull shape, and the use of carbon fiber, which is less reliable under extreme pressure compared to traditional materials. Despite concerns raised by experts and former Oceangate staff regarding safety, the CEO dismissed warnings and opted not to have the Titan certified by independent organizations. The hearings aim to uncover accountability and prevent similar incidents in the future.",
