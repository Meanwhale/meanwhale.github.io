    "news_text": "The recent budget has been labeled as catastrophic for the pub industry, with predictions of a pint price increase by up to 40p. The hospitality sector is outraged over rising National Insurance contributions, minimum wage hikes, and increased business rates. Pub owners like Anthony Pender warn that these costs will force them to raise prices significantly, potentially charging \u00a38 for a pint in small pubs. The Chancellor defends the tax increases as necessary for public services, but concerns arise that these will ultimately burden workers and consumers. The measures particularly affect small businesses, which constitute 99.2% of UK businesses, and may lead to reduced hours and layoffs.",
