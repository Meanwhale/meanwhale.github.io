    "news_text": "Trade unions are challenging the legality of threats to dismiss civil servants under Trump's plan to reduce the federal workforce. A federal judge has temporarily frozen these efforts, extending the deadline for federal workers to accept severance offers. Over 40,000 employees have accepted the offer, but this is a small fraction of the two million eligible. The administration aims for 5-10% voluntary departures as part of Trump's reform promises, influenced by Elon Musk.",
