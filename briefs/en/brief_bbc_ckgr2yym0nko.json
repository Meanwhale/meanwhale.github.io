    "news_text": "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, a 71-year-old French woman, testified in court against her husband, Dominique, who is accused of drugging and raping her while inviting other men to do the same. During her testimony, she emphasized that women should not feel shame for being victims of rape and encouraged them to stand up against their abusers. Pelicot expressed her devastation over her husband's betrayal, recalling their 50 years together and how he had seemingly cared for her. She described the emotional turmoil she has faced and criticized the defense's claims that the defendants did not know she was unconscious. The trial has garnered significant public attention in France, with Pelicot becoming a feminist symbol for her decision to waive anonymity and seek an open trial. The proceedings began on September 2 and are expected to conclude with a verdict in late December.",
