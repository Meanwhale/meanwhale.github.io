    "news_header": "The 2024 temperature record was influenced by El Ni\u00f1o, but human activity was the main cause of warming, exceeding the critical 1.5 \u00b0C limit for the first time.",
    "news_text": "The year 2024 set temperature records, largely due to human-induced climate emissions, which raised global average temperatures by 1.6 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. El Ni\u00f1o contributed to this phenomenon, but the main driver was human activity. The Paris Agreement's critical limit of 1.5 \u00b0C has not been breached yet, but projections indicate that without significant changes, temperatures could exceed this limit in the early 2030s. Extreme weather events have increased, with Finland experiencing record heat days, and climate scientists express disappointment over the lack of global action to mitigate these changes.",
