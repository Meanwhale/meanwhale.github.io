    "news_text": "Monaco, a small yet affluent principality with a diverse population, is experiencing a surge in demand for housing due to an expected increase in ultra-high-net-worth individuals. Property consultant Knight Frank predicts a 23% rise in such individuals and a 43% increase in dollar millionaires over the next five years. With only 21,123 dwellings, Monaco is under pressure to expand its housing supply. Two major projects, Bay House and Mareterra, are set to be completed, adding over 180 new homes. Despite a decline in sales transactions in 2023, property prices have grown significantly over the past decade, with a recent 1% increase in 2024. The principality's appeal is heightened by rising taxes and geopolitical tensions elsewhere, prompting many high-net-worth individuals to consider relocating to Monaco.",
