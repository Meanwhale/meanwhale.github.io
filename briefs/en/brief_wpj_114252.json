    "news_text": "Monaco, with a population of 38,367 and 141 nationalities, is a global safe haven and low-tax jurisdiction. Knight Frank predicts a 23% increase in ultra-high-net-worth individuals and a 43% rise in dollar millionaires over the next five years. With only 21,123 dwellings, 81% privately owned, housing demand is intense. Two major projects, Bay House and Mareterra, are set to be completed, adding new apartments and villas. A 15-year housing plan initiated by Prince Albert aims to increase state-owned apartments by 43%. The attractiveness of Monaco is rising due to geopolitical tensions and tax changes in the UK and Europe. Despite a decline in resale transactions, property prices have grown 38% over the past decade, with a 1% increase in 2024.",
