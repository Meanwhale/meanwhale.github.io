    "news_text": "Santorini has been struck by a powerful 5.3 magnitude earthquake, the strongest in recent seismic activity on the Greek island. The tremors were felt as far away as Athens, with a focal depth of 17km. Residents of nearby Amorgos are on high alert following this quake, which came after a moderate 5.0 magnitude earthquake the previous evening. Since January, Santorini has experienced over 12,800 quakes, leading to landslides and safety patrols to deter tourists from dangerous areas. Although no significant damage or injuries have been reported, a state of emergency is in effect until at least March 3, and schools are closed. Experts remain cautious about the potential for a major earthquake, while a cruise ship rerouted to avoid overcrowding.",
