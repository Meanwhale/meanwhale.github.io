    "news_text": "Only two members of Sir John Franklin's doomed expedition have been identified so far. Captain James Fitzjames's remains were recognized using DNA testing. Fitzjames was part of the 1845 expedition aimed at charting the last unknown section of Canada's Arctic waters. Both ships, Erebus and Terror, became trapped in ice in 1846. The last message from the crew, dated April 25, 1848, noted that Franklin died on June 11, 1847, and that the remaining 105 men planned to abandon the ships and walk to mainland Canada. Researchers believe all who set out perished during the journey. Over 30 crew members' remains have been found, with Fitzjames identified from bones discovered in an Arctic stone pile. The identification was confirmed using a sample from his descendant. This method had previously been used to identify engineer John Gregory's remains. Fitzjames's jawbone revealed cut marks indicating that desperate crew members had resorted to cannibalism after his death. Inuit accounts from the 1850s mentioned survivors consuming deceased companions, and a 1997 study found cut marks on nearly one in four bones discovered in the area. The wreck of Erebus was found in 2014, followed by Terror in 2016.",
