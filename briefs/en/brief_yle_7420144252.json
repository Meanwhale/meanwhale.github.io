    "news_header": "Caruna, an electricity network company, believes it has complied with tax laws despite criticism from Finnwatch regarding its tax practices. Finnwatch claims that recent changes to interest-reduction restrictions have led to Caruna&#x27;s alleged tax avoidance, which was previously facilitated by a balance sheet exemption.",
    "news_original_title": "Finnwatch: Lainmuutos laittoi Carunan korkokikkailun kuriin",
    "news_text": "This exemption was eliminated in 2023, resulting in increased taxes for Caruna. The company acknowledges the need for significant future investments but insists it operates within legal tax frameworks. Finnwatch also notes that another company, Elena, has not faced similar issues and calls for further reforms in tax regulations.",
