Economists warn that these tariffs could raise consumer prices and lead to inflation, while also potentially igniting a global trade war. The White House has given officials 180 days to identify countries with higher tariffs than the US, with the aim of targeting those first. The announcement has sparked negotiations with various countries, including India and the EU, which have expressed concerns about the implications of these tariffs.",
