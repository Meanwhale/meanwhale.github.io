    "news_text": "International cooperation among space agencies focuses on altering the trajectory of an asteroid to protect Earth. Two years ago, NASA's DART spacecraft successfully impacted the 151-meter-wide moon Dimorphos, shortening its orbit around the Didymos asteroid by 33 minutes. The European Space Agency's Hera spacecraft is set to investigate the impact site, launching on October 7, 2023. Hera will deploy two satellites, measure Dimorphos's mass and structure, and capture detailed images of its surface. The mission involves collaboration from numerous companies across 18 ESA member states, including contributions from Finnish firms. While the likelihood of a catastrophic asteroid impact is low, ongoing monitoring and research are crucial, especially for smaller asteroids that pose a threat to Earth.",
