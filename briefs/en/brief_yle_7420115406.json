    "news_text": "Space agencies are collaborating to investigate asteroids, focusing on the recent success of NASA's DART spacecraft, which impacted the 151-meter Dimorphos moon, shortening its orbit around the Didymos asteroid by 33 minutes. The European Space Agency's Hera mission is set to launch on October 7, 2023, to further study the collision site and gather data on Dimorphos and Didymos, which are a double asteroid system. Hera will deploy satellites to measure Dimorphos's mass and structure and capture images of its surface. The project involves multiple ESA member companies and aims to enhance understanding of asteroids, especially given the historical impacts on Earth, including the event that led to the extinction of dinosaurs. There are concerns about potentially hazardous asteroids, with many smaller ones remaining less studied.",
