    "news_text": "The term 'Zeitenwende,' meaning 'a change of times,' is frequently used in German politics to describe the shifts in foreign and defense policies post-Russia's Ukraine invasion, as well as the transformation in the German economy, especially in the auto sector. Volkswagen, facing declining profits and market challenges due to the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) and competition from Chinese manufacturers, is struggling significantly. The company plans to cut jobs and close plants, while the German automotive industry may lose an additional 140,000 jobs in the coming decade. Political leaders are calling for support and reforms to aid this transition, as the current economic climate poses serious challenges for German industry.",
