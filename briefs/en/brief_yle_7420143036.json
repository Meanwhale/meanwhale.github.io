    "news_text": "President Donald Trump has announced a ban on the use of paper straws by the US Federal Administration, reversing the Biden administration&#x27;s efforts to reduce disposable plastic use. Trump criticized the previous policy, stating that it is ridiculous and asserting that the federal government should exclusively use plastic straws. This executive order repeals procurement policies that encouraged paper straw usage and mandates federal agencies to stop purchasing them. Trump declared Biden&#x27;s environmental policy dead, despite ongoing concerns about plastic pollution affecting marine life. Some states and cities have already banned plastic straws, and Trump previously sold reusable plastic straws during his campaign.",
