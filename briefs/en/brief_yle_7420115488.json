    "news_text": "Tuija Siltam\u00e4ki discusses the trend of Finland transitioning into a 'consultant democracy', where power and resources are increasingly held by consultants and lobbyists rather than the state. This shift has led to a situation where various sectors, like the horse industry, produce dubious impact analyses to justify funding. The author argues that the government is less willing to fund essential services, preferring to allocate money to projects that require constant justification. This results in a competitive environment where those who can best lobby for funds succeed, rather than those whose work is most beneficial to society. Siltam\u00e4ki suggests that cutting unnecessary bureaucratic spending, such as reports and campaigns, could be a more effective way to save money.",
