    "news_text": "The text discusses the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff, which resulted in over 9,000 deaths, making it the deadliest maritime disaster in history, far surpassing the Titanic. The incident occurred during World War II when a Soviet submarine, S-13, commanded by Captain Aleksandr Marinesko, torpedoed the ship during an evacuation operation. The text also highlights Finland's involvement in these events, as Soviet submarines operated from Finnish ports during the war. The narrative touches on the historical context of Hanko, the evacuation operations, and the lesser-known tragedies of the war, including the sinking of another ship, General von Steuben, which resulted in an additional 3,000 deaths. The author reflects on the lack of recognition for these tragedies compared to the Titanic.",
