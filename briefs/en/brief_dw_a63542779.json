    "news_text": "Polio, caused by the poliovirus, is a highly contagious disease that can lead to permanent disability and death, particularly in children under five. There are two forms of polio: wild poliovirus, which has been eradicated in most countries except Afghanistan and Pakistan, and vaccine-derived poliovirus, which has been found in Yemen and central Africa. The disease has three virus types, with type 1 being the only remaining wild form. Most polio infections are asymptomatic, but some individuals experience severe symptoms, including paralysis. Polio spreads through contact with infected respiratory droplets or feces, especially in areas with poor sanitation. Despite significant progress in vaccination efforts, polio has not been eradicated globally, with recent cases reported in various regions. Vaccines, including the oral polio vaccine (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), are available to prevent the disease, though the OPV carries a risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus. Ongoing vaccination campaigns are crucial to prevent resurgence.",
