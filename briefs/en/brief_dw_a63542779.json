    "news_text": "Polio, caused by the poliovirus, is a contagious disease that can lead to permanent disability and death, especially in children under five. There are two types of polio: wild poliovirus, which has been largely eradicated except in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and vaccine-derived poliovirus, found in regions like Yemen and central Africa. While most infected individuals are asymptomatic, some experience flu-like symptoms, and a small percentage may suffer severe consequences, including paralysis. The virus spreads through contact with infected respiratory droplets or feces, particularly in areas with poor sanitation. Despite significant progress in vaccination leading to the declaration of over a hundred countries as polio-free, recent cases of vaccine-derived polio have emerged in the US, UK, and Israel, highlighting the need for continued vigilance. There are two vaccines available: the oral polio vaccine (OPV), which is effective but can mutate in unvaccinated populations, and the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is safer but does not prevent virus spread. Care for polio symptoms includes rest, pain relief, and physical therapy.",
