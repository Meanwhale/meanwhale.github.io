    "news_text": "Polio, caused by the poliovirus, is a contagious disease that can result in severe disability or death, especially in children under five. There are two types of polio: wild poliovirus, which has been largely eradicated except in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and vaccine-derived poliovirus, which can emerge from the oral polio vaccine (OPV) in areas with poor sanitation. While most infected individuals show no symptoms, some experience flu-like symptoms, and a small percentage may suffer from paralysis. The disease spreads through respiratory droplets and feces, and can contaminate food and water. Despite significant global vaccination efforts, polio has not been fully eradicated, with recent cases reported in various countries. Vaccines, including OPV and the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), are available to prevent the disease, but challenges remain with vaccine-derived strains. Care for polio symptoms includes rest, pain relief, and physical therapy.",
