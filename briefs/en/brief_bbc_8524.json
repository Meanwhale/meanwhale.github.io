    "news_text": "A recent stock market rally in China lost momentum following a highly-anticipated announcement aimed at boosting the economy, which left investors underwhelmed. After a 10% surge post-Golden Week, the Shanghai Composite Index closed 4.6% higher, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 9.4%. Investors expected more detailed plans for economic support, but the announcement lacked specifics. Zheng Shanjie, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, expressed confidence in achieving economic goals but acknowledged increasing downward pressures. The Chinese government plans to allocate 200 billion yuan ($28bn) for spending and investment projects by year-end. Analysts suggest that the market's reaction reflects disappointment over the absence of substantial fiscal stimulus, and there are concerns that the government's measures may not adequately address the deeper economic issues, including a property market slump and declining prices.",
