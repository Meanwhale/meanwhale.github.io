    "news_text": "After months of opposition, President Biden vetoed the proposed $14.9 billion buyout of US Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel, citing national security risks and the potential impact on American jobs. The deal had previously been approved by US Steel but faced significant political scrutiny due to its implications for the US steel industry and competition from foreign entities. Biden emphasized the need for critical industries to remain under domestic control, while Nippon Steel argued the acquisition would benefit US Steel and its workers. The decision may hinder US Steel's ability to modernize and compete globally.",
