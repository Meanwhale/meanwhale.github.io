    "news_text": "In Georgia, early voting for the November 5 presidential election saw a record turnout, with over 252,000 voters participating by 4 p.m. EDT, nearly double the number from the 2020 election's opening day. State officials praised the turnout, noting some locations experienced long wait times while others had none. Both Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump engaged in media interviews to promote their campaigns. Harris discussed her prosecutorial record and police reforms, while Trump focused on tax breaks for lower-income Americans and defended his trade policies. Additionally, billionaire Elon Musk significantly funded Trump's pro-voter turnout PAC, highlighting its importance in swing states like Georgia.",
