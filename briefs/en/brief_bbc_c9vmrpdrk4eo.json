    "news_text": "Insolvency specialists report a significant increase in UK businesses experiencing critical financial distress, particularly in hospitality, leisure, and retail, with the construction industry also affected. A company is deemed in critical distress if it has a county court judgment over \u00a35,000 or faces a winding-up petition. The last two years have been challenging for many businesses due to rising costs and decreased consumer confidence. The number of businesses in critical distress rose by 50% from September to December last year, reaching 46,583. Factors contributing to this include aggressive tax recovery by HMRC and rising National Insurance contributions. Experts warn that many businesses may struggle to survive into 2025, with a notable decline in consumer spending intentions.",
