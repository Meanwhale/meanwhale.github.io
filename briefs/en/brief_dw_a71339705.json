    "news_text": "Josip Dabro, the Croatian Deputy Prime Minister and agriculture minister, resigned following the release of a video where he is seen laughing and shooting a gun from a moving car. In his resignation, he expressed concern that his actions would distract the government from its priorities. Dabro claimed the video was old and involved training bullets. Despite the incident, the coalition with his party remains stable, according to DP leader Ivan Penava. The Croatian government condemned Dabro's actions as inappropriate. This marks the second ministerial resignation in recent months, following the dismissal of Health Minister Vili Beros amid a corruption investigation.",
