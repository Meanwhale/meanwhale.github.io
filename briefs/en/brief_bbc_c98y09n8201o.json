    "news_text": "The UK government is considering a program where job coaches visit mental health patients in hospitals to provide employment support, following successful trials that reportedly improved patients' mental health. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall aims to reduce the rising costs of disability benefits, projected to increase significantly in the coming years. However, disability rights campaigners have raised concerns about the appropriateness of this approach, fearing it may exacerbate mental health issues. They emphasize the need for evidence that such interventions are beneficial. The government is also preparing a white paper on employment reforms and has highlighted the need for employers to better support workers with mental health conditions.",
