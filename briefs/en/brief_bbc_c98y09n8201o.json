    "news_text": "The UK government, led by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall, is proposing to have job coaches visit mental health patients in hospitals to provide employment support, such as CV writing and interview advice. Trials have shown positive outcomes, but disability rights advocates express concerns that this approach could harm patients' mental health. The government aims to reduce the rising costs of disability benefits, projected to increase significantly in the coming years. Kendall emphasizes the need for evidence supporting the effectiveness of this initiative while acknowledging the importance of compassionate care for those with serious mental health issues. The government is also planning reforms in job centers and employment services to better support individuals with mental health conditions.",
