    "news_text": "Artificial intelligence is playing a significant role in U.S. presidential and congressional elections, prompting calls for vigilance among voters and electoral authorities. A recent incident in New Hampshire involved a deep fake call impersonating Joe Biden, misleading voters about the importance of participating in the primaries. This highlights the potential for AI to be used for political manipulation, with authorities expressing concern over its impact on election integrity. While AI can assist electoral authorities in managing voter data, it also poses risks, such as misidentifying voters and potentially disenfranchising minorities. Current legislation struggles to keep pace with AI developments, and despite some bipartisan initiatives, no federal laws will be in place before the elections. Experts warn that the misuse of AI could lead to significant misinformation on election day, complicating the already contentious political landscape in the U.S.",
