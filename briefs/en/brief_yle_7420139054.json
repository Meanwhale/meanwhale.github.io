In the 2000s, support for investing has grown, with 57% owning shares or fund shares. However, there is a gender gap, with 75% of men feeling optimistic compared to 56% of women. Many Finns see investing as essential for future security, yet 30% have never invested, and 44% fear losing their savings. The study highlights a need for increased financial education and confidence in investing.",
