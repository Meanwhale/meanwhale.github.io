    "news_text": "Rwanda has reported new cases of the Marburg virus, a highly lethal pathogen, prompting heightened alertness in the country. Since late September, at least 36 cases of Marburg virus disease (MRV) have been confirmed, with over 400 individuals currently under observation for symptoms. The Marburg virus, which has an 88% mortality rate among those infected, is zoonotic and primarily transmitted from bats to humans. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, and severe bleeding. There is currently no specific treatment or vaccine for MRV, although trials for a vaccine are underway. Research consortiums are actively working on developing effective vaccines, with some promising candidates already in clinical trials.",
