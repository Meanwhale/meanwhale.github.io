    "news_text": "The Pentagon announced that the US executed precision strikes on five weapons storage sites in Yemen, targeting facilities used by the Iran-backed Houthi movement to attack civilian and military vessels. US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin emphasized the strikes' purpose to degrade Houthi capabilities and protect US interests in critical waterways. The Houthis have launched numerous attacks on ships in the Red Sea, claiming retaliation for Israel's actions in Gaza. The US operation involved long-range bombers and was executed without initial reports of civilian casualties. Austin stated that the US would continue to hold the Houthis accountable for their actions, which have disrupted international trade and prompted responses from Israel.",
