    "news_text": "The Court of Session in Edinburgh ruled that the consent for the Rosebank and Jackdaw oil and gas fields was granted unlawfully, necessitating new approval from the UK government. Environmental campaigners argued that a more detailed environmental impact assessment, including downstream emissions, is required. While work can continue, no extraction is allowed without fresh consent. The ruling has been welcomed by environmentalists, who stress the importance of adhering to climate targets. The companies involved argue that their projects are crucial for UK energy security.",
