    "news_text": "In a recent interview, Charles Michel, President of the European Council, stressed the importance of Europe becoming more independent and resilient regardless of who occupies the White House. As the European Political Community (EPC) summit convenes in Budapest, key concerns include how Europe will respond to Donald Trump's potential presidency and its implications for support to Ukraine and NATO. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a supporter of Trump, has stirred controversy with his diplomatic efforts. EU leaders are preparing for possible economic repercussions from a second Trump term, particularly regarding tariffs that could impact Germany's economy. The EPC, founded in response to Russia's aggression, faces challenges due to Hungary's political stance, which diverges from EU norms.",
