    "news_text": "In less than a week, President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has begun accessing and restructuring federal departments, prompting legal action from congressional Democrats and unions who argue it exceeds its authority and threatens national security. DOGE, which is not an official federal department but a task force, aims to cut regulations and spending, but faces scrutiny over its transparency and legality. Critics worry about the implications of its actions, especially regarding the dismantling of agencies like USAID. Legal challenges are mounting against DOGE's access to sensitive information and its proposed cuts, with concerns that its efforts may be unconstitutional.",
