    "news_text": "Sir Keir Starmer has addressed a letter from Sir Alan Bates regarding the need for quicker compensation payments for postmasters affected by the Post Office scandal. Sir Alan has urged the Prime Minister to ensure that victims receive full financial redress by March next year. The government has set aside \u00a31.8bn for those impacted by the Horizon IT scandal, where many sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted due to a faulty accounting system. Campaigners have criticized the slow compensation process, with some victims having died waiting for justice. As of October 31, \u00a3438m has been paid to over 3,100 claimants, but many, like Janet Skinner, are still waiting for their compensation.",
