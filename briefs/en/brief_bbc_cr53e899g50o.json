    "news_text": "WH Smith has announced plans to sell 500 of its UK shops following a 6% decline in High Street sales over 21 weeks, including the Christmas period, which is a 3% decrease from the previous year. The company intends to close 17 stores by 2025 and has already shut down 14 stores in the last financial year. Despite these challenges, WH Smith's travel business is thriving, with plans for expansion in the US. CEO Carl Cowling expressed confidence in the group's strong position and anticipated good growth in 2025. The company is focusing on its travel retail business, which now accounts for over 85% of its profits. Analysts predict the High Street business could be sold for \u00a3100 million or more, with private equity firms showing interest.",
