The authority has requested an investigation into ongoing issues with Nordea's online banking services, which have persisted for weeks due to denial-of-service attacks and technical changes. The Banking Authority seeks to understand how the situation has been addressed and whether all necessary measures have been taken to restore services for Finnish citizens. A meeting is scheduled for next week, where the authority will hear a report and decide on further actions.
