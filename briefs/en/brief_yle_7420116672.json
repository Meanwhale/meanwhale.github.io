    "news_text": "Elon Musk, the world's richest man, and former President Donald Trump have shifted from being fierce critics to political allies over the past two years. Initially, Musk had never voted for a Republican and criticized Trump, while Trump mocked Musk's business ventures. However, recently, Trump praised Musk and his companies, while Musk called Trump the last hope for American democracy. Despite their mutual disdain, both benefit from their alliance: Trump gains financial support, and Musk gains political influence. Musk is expected to campaign for Trump in key states and has begun donating significantly to Republican causes. This political shift coincided with Musk's personal struggles, including a rift with his transgender daughter. Musk's political views have become more radical, and he has used his platform to spread misinformation. As the election approaches, Musk's support for Trump could play a crucial role in shaping the narrative around the campaign.",
