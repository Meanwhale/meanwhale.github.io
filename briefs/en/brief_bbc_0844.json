    "news_text": "Water companies have been ordered to refund \u00a3158m to customers after failing to meet pollution and leak targets for the fourth consecutive year. Although the industry has shown some improvements, no company achieved the top rating, and the overall performance remains unsatisfactory. Thames Water will repay the largest amount, \u00a356.8m, despite improvements. Customers will see minimal bill reductions, overshadowed by a proposed \u00a394 increase over five years. Ofwat, the regulator, faces scrutiny over its effectiveness, with calls for stronger environmental priorities. While some companies have made progress, significant challenges remain, particularly with water leaks and pollution incidents.",
