    "news_text": "Norway has become a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, with 88.9% of new car sales in 2024 being electric. The transition to EVs has been facilitated by a series of long-term policies, including tax exemptions and incentives for electric cars, while making fossil fuel vehicles more expensive through higher taxes. The country aims to have all new cars sold as zero-emission by 2025. Despite being a major oil producer, Norway has successfully shifted consumer behavior towards electric vehicles, supported by a robust charging infrastructure and public awareness. Other countries are encouraged to learn from Norway's approach, which emphasizes strong policies over environmental mindset.",
