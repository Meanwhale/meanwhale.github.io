    "news_text": "At the EU summit in Brussels, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda reflected on past decisions not made regarding Ukraine's NATO membership, which is unlikely to be addressed at the summit. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy promoted his 'victory plan' to EU leaders, reiterating demands for NATO membership and longer-range weapons to strike Russia. While some EU leaders support Ukraine, the US and Germany remain hesitant due to escalation risks. Zelenskyy emphasized the importance of unity among allies and the need for continued sanctions against Russia, while also planning a second international peace summit by November. The EU announced a \u20ac35 billion loan for Ukraine, contingent on sanctions against Russia, which Hungary's Prime Minister Orban is blocking.",
