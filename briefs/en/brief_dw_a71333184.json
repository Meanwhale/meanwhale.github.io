    "news_text": "Poland has fortified its border with Belarus by constructing a 186-kilometer fence equipped with modern surveillance technology in response to increased migration attempts since August 2021. The border crossing at Polowce-Peschatka has been closed since summer 2023, with thick concrete blocks and barbed wire preventing access. Polish authorities claim that irregular migration is orchestrated by Belarus, with migrants arriving legally in Belarus and then being transported to the Polish border. Human rights organizations criticize Poland's practices, including pushbacks into Belarus, while Polish officials defend their actions as necessary for border security.",
