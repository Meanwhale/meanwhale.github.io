    "news_text": "A new study at Kumamoto Sanctuary in Japan shows that chimpanzees exhibit contagious urination behavior. Researchers observed 20 captive chimps for over 600 hours and found that when one chimp urinates, others are likely to follow, especially low-ranking individuals. This behavior is not influenced by social closeness but rather by rank. The study opens avenues for further research into the social dynamics of chimpanzees and their urination behavior.",
