    "news_text": "In light of the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel, many Iranians are closely watching the US presidential election, with a notable preference for Republican candidate Donald Trump over Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. Iranians perceive Trump as a strong leader capable of instigating significant change, particularly in relation to the Islamic Republic. Trump's previous withdrawal from the nuclear agreement and his emphasis on preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons resonate with some Iranians, who believe he could potentially topple the regime. Meanwhile, Israel's recent military actions against Iran highlight the escalating tensions, with analysts suggesting that the outcome of the US election could greatly influence US-Iran relations. If Trump wins, he may push for a new agreement with Iran, while a Harris victory could lead to attempts at temporary agreements. Trump's past successes with the Abraham Accords are also referenced as a potential framework for future peace in the Middle East.",
