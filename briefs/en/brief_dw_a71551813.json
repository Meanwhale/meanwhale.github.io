    "news_text": "Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti&#x27;s ruling party, Vetevendosje (VV), is set to win approximately 41% of the votes in the recent elections, according to the election commission. This marks a decline from over 50% in 2021, meaning Kurti will need to form a coalition to maintain power. The election was reported to have been conducted without major issues, with a voter turnout exceeding 40%. The Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) and the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) followed in second and third places, respectively. Kurti aims to strengthen Kosovo&#x27;s institutions and implement economic reforms, but his actions have raised tensions with ethnic Serbians and Serbia, which does not recognize Kosovo&#x27;s independence.",
