    "news_text": "According to the Mortgage Bankers Association's Weekly Applications Survey, U.S. mortgage applications fell by 1.3% for the week ending September 27, 2024. The Market Composite Index decreased by 1.3% on a seasonally adjusted basis, while the Refinance Index dropped by 3%, although it remains significantly higher than last year. Conversely, the Purchase Index saw a 1% increase, reflecting a 9% rise compared to the same week last year. Mike Fratantoni, MBA's Chief Economist, noted that despite a modest increase in mortgage rates to 6.14%, the market is experiencing solid economic growth and more homebuyers are entering the market due to increased inventory and lower mortgage rates. Refinance applications accounted for 54.9% of total applications, while the FHA share rose to 16.6%. Average interest rates for various mortgage types have also seen slight increases.",
