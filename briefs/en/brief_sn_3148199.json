    "news_text": "Scientists are investigating primordial black holes, which may have formed in the early universe, potentially explaining dark matter. These black holes differ from typical stellar and supermassive black holes, as they would have emerged before stars and galaxies. Recent research has reignited interest in detecting these elusive objects, with evidence suggesting they could account for some or all dark matter. The search for primordial black holes has gained momentum since the detection of gravitational waves from black hole mergers, leading to new theories and collaborative efforts in the field.",
