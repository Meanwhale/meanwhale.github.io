    "news_text": "Harrods has announced it is in the process of settling more than 250 compensation claims from women who allege historical sexual misconduct by Mohamed Al Fayed, the former owner of the department store. This comes after a BBC documentary aired, exposing serious sexual abuse allegations against Al Fayed, who owned Harrods from 1985 to 2010. Harrods has already settled some claims and has a compensation scheme for ex-employees who claim to have been attacked by Al Fayed. The current owners of Harrods expressed their horror at the allegations and are investigating potential involvement of current staff. The Justice for Harrods Survivors group is working with 147 women, though it is unclear how many are pursuing legal action. Al Fayed, who passed away last year, is accused of multiple counts of rape and attempted rape, with many victims feeling unable to report the incidents until recently. The BBC investigation revealed that Harrods not only failed to intervene but may have covered up the abuse allegations during Al Fayed's ownership.",
