    "news_text": "In the third quarter of 2024, housing prices in Ireland increased by an average of 3.1%, with the typical price reaching \u20ac344,848, a 6.2% rise from the previous year and a 37% increase since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Dublin saw the largest increase at 4.1%, marking the highest quarterly rise since early 2017. For the first time since 2020, Dublin's annual inflation rate surpassed that of other major cities in Ireland. The supply of second-hand homes has dropped significantly, with fewer than 11,900 homes available, a 12% decrease from last year, leading to higher prices. Economist Ronan Lyons noted that while new home construction remains steady, the second-hand market is weak, resulting in increased prices, particularly in Dublin, where homes sold for an average of 7.6% above their listed price. The ongoing issue of housing scarcity needs to be addressed by policymakers.",
