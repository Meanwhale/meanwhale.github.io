    "news_text": "Donald Trump has announced intentions to raise tariffs on foreign goods, proposing up to 20% on imports and 60% on Chinese goods, with some cars facing a potential 200% tax. He argues that these tariffs will protect American jobs and stimulate the economy, asserting that the costs will fall on foreign countries. However, economists largely disagree, stating that tariffs function as domestic taxes that consumers ultimately pay through higher prices. Historical data from Trump's first term shows that tariffs imposed led to increased prices for consumers, with estimates suggesting middle-income households could lose between $1,700 to $3,900 annually under his proposed tariffs. Moreover, Trump's tariffs have not effectively reduced the trade deficit, which grew during his presidency. While some economists support tariffs as a means to bolster US industry, the majority view them as detrimental to consumers and overall economic health.",
