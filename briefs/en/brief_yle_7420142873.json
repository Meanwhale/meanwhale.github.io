    "news_text": "A recent doctoral study by Taina Kankaala at the University of Oulu explores how trained therapy dogs can alleviate dental anxiety in patients. The presence of these dogs during treatment helps distract patients from their fears, making them more comfortable. The study involved 12 patients who had previously avoided dental care due to fear. Results showed that the dogs played a crucial role in easing anxiety, with no significant differences found among dog breeds. The findings highlight the potential benefits of incorporating therapy dogs in dental practices to improve patient experiences.",
