    "news_text": "US President Donald Trump described the economic relationship with the EU as an &#x27;atrocity,&#x27; claiming a trade deficit of about $350 billion, which EU data refutes, showing a $53 billion surplus for the EU. Trump threatened to impose tariffs on EU goods, but EU leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Luxembourg Prime Minister Luc Frieden, responded with a unified front, emphasizing the importance of trans-Atlantic relations. The EU is also looking to strengthen its defense strategy and reduce dependence on the US, while considering measures to avert US tariffs. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed readiness for negotiations to enhance US-EU cooperation.",
