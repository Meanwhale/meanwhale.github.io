    "news_text": "India is the largest exporter of human hair, but the industry faces challenges, including low wages for hair collectors. While India exports hair to China for wig production, there is potential for growth in the domestic market. Companies like Diva Divine Hair are working to create high-quality wigs, and advancements in technology are making wigs more appealing. The demand for Indian human hair is increasing globally, and Ali hopes to see more Indian-designed wigs in the market.",
