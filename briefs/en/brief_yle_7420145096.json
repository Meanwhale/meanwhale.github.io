    "news_text": "Israel has conducted airstrikes on the Syrian-Lebanese border, targeting illegal crossings used for smuggling weapons to Hezbollah. The strikes occurred in Wadi Khaled, Lebanon, and near Homs, Syria. This action is part of Israel&#x27;s efforts to curb the flow of arms from Syria to Hezbollah, especially after a fragile truce was established last November. The situation escalated after Hezbollah lost a key smuggling route following the rebels&#x27; victory over Bashar al-Assad in December.",
