    "news_text": "During a meeting in Brussels on September 19, China's commerce minister Wang Wentao and EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis discussed the EU's plans to impose tariffs of up to 36% on certain Chinese electric vehicle imports. This follows an EU investigation into China's state subsidies, which the EU claims give Chinese automakers an unfair advantage. Despite China's rejection of these findings, both sides agreed to seek a WTO-compatible solution. Reports suggest the EU may consider lowering some proposed tariffs, but Wang expressed that they remain too high. China has threatened retaliatory measures against EU products and has initiated investigations into European imports like pork and dairy. The situation has caused divisions within the EU, with some member states showing support for China, while others back the EU's stance. Analysts believe that while China is using threats of tariffs to influence EU member states, it is unlikely to escalate the conflict significantly.",
