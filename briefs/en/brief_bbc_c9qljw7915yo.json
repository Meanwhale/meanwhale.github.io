    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves of the Labour government asserted that they were unaware of a \u00a322bn overspend in public spending when they assumed power. She stated that the previous Conservative government had made unfunded commitments, which were not disclosed to them. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) confirmed that the Treasury withheld information about \u00a39.5bn in spending commitments, leading to a misrepresentation of the public finances. Shadow Chancellor Jeremy Hunt noted that the OBR did not criticize the Conservatives and highlighted that the Labour government increased taxes by \u00a340bn, despite the claimed overspend. Reeves plans to implement the OBR's recommendations to improve transparency in future budget dealings.",
