    "news_text": "A federal judge has temporarily halted President Trump's plan to incentivize federal workers to resign before a deadline. The judge's decision came after a lawsuit from employee unions, which argued the plan violated the law and could harm the civil service. The White House claims over 40,000 employees accepted the offer, but confusion remains about its terms. The judge's ruling allows for more workers to consider resigning, while concerns about national security and the impact on government operations have been raised.",
