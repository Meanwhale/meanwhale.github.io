    "news_text": "The study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences indicates that enhancing livestock farming in centralized areas and converting former grasslands back to forests could provide substantial climate benefits. Researchers from the University of New York and Aalto University found that a moderate reduction in meat production in affluent countries could potentially eliminate up to 125 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions, equivalent to three years of global fossil fuel emissions. The research emphasizes that reducing meat consumption could improve both human health and environmental conditions, particularly in high-income regions like Europe and North America. It suggests that targeted reductions in beef production in high and upper mid-income countries could lead to significant climate benefits without necessitating a complete overhaul of the global food system.",
