    "news_text": "At least 40 Chadian soldiers were killed in an attack on their base on Sunday evening, leading President Mahamat D\u00e9by to order a counter-mission to find those responsible. The attack occurred on Barkaram island, near Nigeria and Niger, areas known for Islamist militant activity. Local residents suspect Boko Haram was involved. This incident marks one of the deadliest attacks on Chadian forces since 2020. President D\u00e9by, a trained soldier, visited the site to assess the situation and support the troops. The Lake Chad region is part of a multinational effort to combat armed groups, but challenges persist due to regrouping militants. Chad remains a stable partner for the West amidst regional crises and is enhancing ties with Russia while managing a refugee influx from Sudan.",
