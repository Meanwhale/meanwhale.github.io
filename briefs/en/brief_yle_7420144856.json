    "news_text": "Finnish scientists express concerns over NATO&#x27;s plan to send troops to Ukraine, emphasizing the need for a lasting ceasefire before deployment. The initiative, led by Britain and France, aims to secure air and maritime defense with fewer than 30,000 troops. Researchers highlight unresolved issues and the risk of conflict with Russia if troops are not adequately deterred. The credibility of the deterrent is questioned, especially without U.S. support. Finland, while capable of sending troops, must prioritize its own defense. The discussion around troop deployment is deemed critical, with potential implications for European security.",
