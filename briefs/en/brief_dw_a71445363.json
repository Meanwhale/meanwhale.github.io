    "news_original_title": "Are Trump's Gaza plans a threat to neighboring countries?",
    "news_text": "US President Donald Trump proposed that Jordan, Egypt, and other Arab nations should take in more Palestinian refugees from the Gaza Strip, suggesting a relocation could be temporary or long-term. He emphasized the dire situation in Gaza, describing it as a 'demolition site.' However, his proposal faced immediate backlash from Egypt and Jordan, both of which firmly rejected the idea, citing concerns over expanding regional conflict and the importance of Palestinian identity and rights. Egypt's Foreign Ministry warned that such a transfer could escalate tensions, while Jordan's government reiterated that it would not serve as an alternative homeland for Palestinians. Both nations expressed solidarity with the Palestinian quest for statehood and raised security concerns regarding the potential instability that could arise from large refugee camps.",
