    "news_header": "Coca-Cola may need to increase its production of plastic bottles in the US due to potential price hikes in aluminum cans caused by President Trump&#x27;s tariffs. The company has reduced its sustainability goal from using 50% recycled materials by 2030 to 35-40% by 2035. Environmental groups have criticized Coca-Cola as a leading plastic polluter.",
    "news_original_title": "Coca-Cola says it may use more plastic due to Trump tariffs",
    "news_text": "CEO James Quincey stated that if aluminum costs rise, they can shift focus to PET bottles, while downplaying the tariffs&#x27; impact on overall costs. The US imports nearly half of its aluminum, making cans more expensive under the new tariffs. Additionally, Trump has ended a government initiative to replace plastic straws with paper, further contributing to plastic pollution.",
