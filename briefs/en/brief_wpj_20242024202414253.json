    "news_text": "ATTOM Data's U.S. Home Affordability Report for Q3 2024 shows that single-family homes and condos are less affordable in 99% of analyzed counties. Homeownership costs now consume 33.5% of the average national wage, exceeding the preferred 28% benchmark. Although there has been a slight improvement due to declining mortgage rates, costs remain high with the national median home price at $365,000. The report highlights that while some counties have seen wage growth outpacing home price increases, 78% still require more than 28% of wages for homeownership. Major counties like Los Angeles and Chicago are among the least affordable, while areas like Harris County and Wayne County are more affordable. Overall, despite some positive trends, homeownership remains a financial challenge for many.",
