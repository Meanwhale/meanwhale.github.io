    "news_text": "A study reveals that vampire bats metabolize food more like blood-feeding flies, using amino acids from recent blood meals as energy during exercise. This is unlike other mammals that typically rely on carbohydrates or fats. Researchers found that a significant portion of the carbon dioxide exhaled by the bats during workouts came from metabolizing proteins, indicating a unique metabolic process. The findings suggest that vampire bats may be more susceptible to starvation due to their reliance on amino acids, which are not as readily accessible as other energy sources.",
