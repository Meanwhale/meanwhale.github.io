    "news_text": "The German Foreign Ministry summoned its ambassador to Iran to express a strong protest following the execution of Jamshid Sharmahd, a German-Iranian political dissident accused of leading the Tondar group. Activists suggest that Iran's regime often increases executions during times of political and economic pressure. Sharmahd, who was captured in a complex operation and sentenced to death for various charges, including involvement in a deadly bombing, faced allegations of torture and a lack of fair legal representation. His execution is seen as a warning to dissenters and reflects the regime's reliance on repression. Concerns are rising over the fate of other political prisoners in Iran, as many face similar death sentences.",
