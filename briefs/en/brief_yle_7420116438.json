    "news_header": "Eva proposes a job-seeking visa for non-EU skilled workers to attract talent to Finland.",
    "news_text": "The Finnish Business Delegation (Eva) suggests introducing a job-seeking visa that would allow non-EU skilled workers to search for jobs in Finland for six months without access to Finnish social security. This visa targets individuals with a high likelihood of employment based on their education, skills, or work history. If a permanent job is secured during the visa period, the individual would be eligible for a residence permit. Eva also advocates for the removal of the labor market test, which currently restricts hiring from outside the EU if suitable candidates are available within Finland or Europe. Some government parties support this proposal, while others, including the Finns Party and the Minister of Labor, oppose changes to the current labor market test.",
