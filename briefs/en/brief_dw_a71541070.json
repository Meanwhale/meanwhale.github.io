    "news_text": "Following a contested election on February 8, 2024, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the PML-N have taken control of the government, while the PTI party, led by imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan, has been banned from contesting. Despite Khan&#x27;s popularity and calls for protests, analysts suggest that the PML-N, supported by the military, has consolidated power. Khan faces numerous legal challenges, including a recent 14-year sentence for corruption, which his party claims is politically motivated. The political crisis reflects a deep confrontation between Khan and the military, with ongoing protests failing to shift the balance of power. Economically, Pakistan has seen some stabilization, with inflation dropping to its lowest in nine years, aided by IMF support and a new World Bank loan agreement. Analysts suggest that a path forward for democracy requires consensus on future elections and dialogue between opposing parties.",
