    "news_text": "Israel has provisionally approved an agreement with Hamas for a reciprocal exchange of prisoners and a truce, but Hamas has not yet decided its position. A meeting is set for Tuesday, and while sources suggest a positive response is likely, the Israeli government still needs to approve it. Hamas would release 33 hostages in exchange for 1,000 Palestinians, including serious offenders. The first hostages are to be released once the agreement is approved, and negotiations for further exchanges are expected to begin within 16 days.",
