    "news_text": "The Finnish government has not disclosed its plans to address the consequences of pharyngitis. Experts assert that the EU will maintain its climate targets for forests. Environment Advisor Tuomo Kalliokoski emphasizes the urgency of strengthening forest carbon sinks, suggesting financial controls like taxes and fines. Finland&#x27;s carbon sink debt has reached alarming levels, and the government is urged to restore previous regulations on forest management. Current measures are deemed insufficient, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is preparing a package to improve forest growth. However, experts warn that the proposed actions may not sufficiently address the significant carbon sink deficit.",
