    "news_text": "The Finnish government has not disclosed its plans to address the significant carbon sink debt resulting from pharyngitis, which has reached alarming levels. Experts, including Environment Advisor Tuomo Kalliokoski, emphasize the need for financial controls, such as taxes and fines, to enhance forest carbon sinks without directly limiting logging. The Forest Act should be revised to reinstate minimum age requirements for trees eligible for felling. Finland&#x27;s carbon sink obligations stem from EU regulations, necessitating the binding of 19 million tons of CO2 annually from 2021 to 2025. However, Finnish forests are currently emitting CO2 rather than absorbing it, with a cumulative deficit of 100 million tons. The government has yet to propose effective measures, and while some initiatives are being prepared, they may not adequately address the urgent situation. Experts warn that without significant changes, Finland&#x27;s carbon sink deficit will continue to grow, complicating future climate targets.",
