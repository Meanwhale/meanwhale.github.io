    "news_text": "Health authorities reported that at least 75 individuals across 13 states have been infected with a deadly E. coli strain linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounders. The CDC confirmed that 22 people have been hospitalized, and one person has died. Most cases are concentrated in western and Midwest states. In response, McDonald's has temporarily removed Quarter Pounders and fresh onions from many of its locations, as officials investigate the source of contamination, potentially linked to onions supplied by Taylor Farms. The CDC believes the public risk is low due to these actions. Other food chains are also taking precautionary measures. Symptoms of E. coli infection can include severe stomach issues and may lead to serious complications like kidney failure. The first lawsuit related to the outbreak has been filed against McDonald's.",
