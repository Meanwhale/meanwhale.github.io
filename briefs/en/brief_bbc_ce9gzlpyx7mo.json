    "news_text": "McDonald's has taken quarter pounders and fresh onions off the menu in roughly 20% of its US locations following an E. coli outbreak that has resulted in 49 reported cases across 10 states, with one death and several hospitalizations. Most cases are concentrated in Colorado and Nebraska. The CDC and FDA are investigating the source, with onions being a potential cause. Other food chains, like Burger King and Yum! Brands, are also removing onions from select locations. McDonald's shares fell by 7% after the news broke, and the company is working to resolve the issue and return quarter pounders to affected areas soon. A lawsuit has been filed against McDonald's by a customer who fell ill after eating there.",
