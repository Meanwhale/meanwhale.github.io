    "news_text": "Despite comprehensive EU sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, Russian oil imports into the EU remain substantial, with many countries still heavily reliant on Russian energy. EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson has expressed concern over increasing gas purchases from Russia, particularly from Central European nations like Hungary and Slovakia, which depend on Russian gas for around 80% of their needs. While some countries, like the Czech Republic, are making strides to reduce dependence on Russian oil, others, such as Hungary, are deepening their ties. The situation is complicated by Ukraine's plans to halt gas transit through its pipelines, which could force EU countries to seek alternative energy sources. The EU is considering new sanctions to address these issues, but political will among member states varies significantly.",
