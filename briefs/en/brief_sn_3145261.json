    "news_text": "Research published in the American Journal of Public Health indicates that pregnant individuals who utilized doula services alongside medical care experienced a 47% lower risk of C-sections and a 29% lower risk of preterm births compared to those without a doula. Additionally, doula users were 46% more likely to attend postpartum checkups. The study analyzed Medicaid data from over 1 million records, focusing on 1,444 individuals matched by various characteristics. While the findings align with previous studies, researchers noted limitations such as the inability to match individuals based on the timing of doula services. The increasing coverage of doula care through Medicaid in various states highlights the growing recognition of their role in improving maternal health outcomes.",
