    "news_text": "A new wildfire, named the Hughes Fire, has erupted north of Los Angeles, prompting the evacuation of over 31,000 residents. The fire has rapidly spread over nearly 41 square kilometers, affecting areas near Lake Castaic. Authorities have issued evacuation warnings for an additional 20,000 people. While no properties have been reported destroyed yet, the fire is fueled by strong winds, complicating containment efforts. Other nearby wildfires, Eaton and Palisades, are nearing full containment but have already caused significant destruction and loss of life. President Trump has threatened to withhold federal aid until California changes its water management practices, linking the severity of these fires to climate change.",
