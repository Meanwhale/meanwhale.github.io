    "news_text": "Ali Razini and Mohammad Moghiseh, two senior judges in Iran's supreme court, were shot dead by a gunman who later killed himself. The motive remains unclear, but both judges had been involved in the crackdown on government opponents since the 1980s. The judiciary described the attack as a premeditated assassination, and investigations are ongoing to determine if others were involved. Razini was 71 and had survived a previous assassination attempt, while Moghiseh, 68, faced sanctions for alleged human rights abuses.",
