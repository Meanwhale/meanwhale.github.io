    "news_text": "Mountain police in Italy have advised tourists to maintain a safe distance of at least 500 meters from Mount Etna&#x27;s lava flows after the volcano&#x27;s recent eruption on February 11. Visitors are required to be accompanied by guides, and skiing in the area is currently prohibited. Despite these restrictions, many people have been seen ignoring the rules. The eruption has also affected air travel, causing Catania Airport to divert numerous flights due to ash clouds. Meanwhile, severe weather conditions, including Storm Blair and Storm Darragh, have impacted the UK and parts of the US, with warnings for high winds and travel disruptions.",
