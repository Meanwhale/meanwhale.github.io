    "news_text": "A recent study suggests that consuming more than four cups of coffee daily can lower the risk of head and neck cancer by 17%. The research, based on data from over 25,000 individuals, indicates that those who drink four or more cups of caffeinated coffee have a significantly reduced risk of oral and throat cancers. While previous studies have explored the relationship between coffee consumption and cancer risk, this study emphasizes the varying effects of coffee and tea on different types of head and neck cancers. The findings support the need for further research on coffee's potential protective effects against cancer.",
