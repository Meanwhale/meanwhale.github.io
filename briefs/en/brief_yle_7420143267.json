    "news_text": "Current sanctions have not effectively halted tanker operations, and many vessels are part of the Russian Shadow Fleet. Experts suggest that sanctions should target buyer countries and the entire oil production chain, not just the tankers. The EU faces challenges in enforcing sanctions, especially with only 80 ships on its list. There are calls for insurance requirements for vessels passing through the Danish straits to mitigate risks. The ownership of shadow ships is often obscured, with many owned by European entities. The need for unified action among EU member states is emphasized to effectively combat the shadow fleet.",
