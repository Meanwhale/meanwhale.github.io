    "news_text": "During his short visit to Germany, President Joe Biden highlighted his ongoing commitment to global leadership, particularly in the Middle East and Ukraine, as he approaches the end of his term. He received Germany's highest honor from President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, reflecting his focus on European defense, contrasting with former President Trump's approach. Biden stressed the need for sustained support for Ukraine amidst the ongoing conflict with Russia, while concerns loom over the potential shift in U.S. foreign policy depending on the outcome of the upcoming elections. European leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, face domestic pressures and challenges in military investment, raising questions about Europe's ability to independently support Ukraine. The meeting with key allies also addressed broader regional issues, but specific military support requests from Ukraine remain unmet.",
