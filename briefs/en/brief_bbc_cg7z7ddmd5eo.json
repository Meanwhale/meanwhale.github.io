    "news_text": "Thames has faced criticism for sewage discharges and leaks, serving about a quarter of the UK&#x27;s population. The rescue plan involves two loan installments, with the first \u00a31.5bn payment due to support the company through the autumn. Thames is appealing a regulator&#x27;s decision on household bill increases, arguing for a 53% rise instead of the capped 35%. The company&#x27;s struggles are attributed to poor regulation, shareholder actions, and climate change.",
