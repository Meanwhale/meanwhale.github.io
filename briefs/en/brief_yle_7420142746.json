    "news_text": "The Gulf of Finland Coast Guard states that Russia has confirmed there is no oil damage in Laukaanu. Russian media made unusual claims about the Koala tanker being damaged, but the Finnish Border Guard has been informed by Russian authorities that there was no oil spill. There were reports of explosions in the Koala&#x27;s engine room, prompting precautionary measures at the port. However, access to reliable information from Russia is limited. The Koala can carry 130,000 tons of cargo, and while there are concerns about oil spills, experts suggest that a major incident is unlikely due to the design of the ship. Russian authorities have made various claims about the incident, including allegations of mining and involvement from Ukraine, but these have been denied.",
