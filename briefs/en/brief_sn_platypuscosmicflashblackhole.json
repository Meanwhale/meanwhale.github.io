    "news_text": "Astronomers have observed a bright cosmic burst, dubbed the Platypus, in a distant dwarf galaxy that may connect two mysterious types of cosmic events: tidal disruption events and luminous fast-blue optical transients (LFBOTs). This event could help scientists understand the origins of supermassive black holes, which are billions of solar masses. The burst, which was 100 times brighter than all the stars in its galaxy, might originate from an intermediate-mass black hole tearing apart a star. Future observations with the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes are planned to clarify its origins.",
