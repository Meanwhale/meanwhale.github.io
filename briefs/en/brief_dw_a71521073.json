    "news_text": "Research published in Nature Medicine indicates that micro- and nanoplastics have increased in human brains and livers from 2016 to 2024. The study suggests that these plastics are likely old degradation products rather than recent exposures. While there is no strong evidence linking microplastics to health effects, some correlation was found between microplastic accumulation and dementia in patients. Experts caution that the study's small sample size limits its applicability and that further research is necessary to understand the health implications of microplastics in the human body.",
