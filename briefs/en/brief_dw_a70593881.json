    "news_text": "President Joe Biden has issued a directive for US national security agencies to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) while addressing its associated risks. A White House memo encourages federal agencies to enhance the security and diversity of chip supply chains with AI considerations. This framework, signed by Biden, follows an executive order from the previous year aimed at AI regulation. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan described it as the first plan to harness AI's power for national security while managing its risks, stressing the urgency for the US to outpace rivals like China in AI deployment. The memo also calls for monitoring AI-related risks, such as privacy invasions and discrimination, and emphasizes collaboration with allies to ensure AI development adheres to international law and human rights. Concerns have been raised regarding potential misuse of AI for surveillance and autonomous weaponry, with the ACLU criticizing the plan for insufficient safeguards. Sullivan, however, assured that the framework aims to protect privacy and human rights while enhancing national security.",
