    "news_text": "The report commissioned by the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) and conducted by consulting firm Gaia calculates that Finland's GDP could increase by \u20ac3 billion annually if 20% of the proposed green investment projects are implemented. Based on EK's list of over \u20ac270 billion in green transition investments, only \u20ac14 billion are currently in production, with many projects still in early planning stages. If about 20% of these projects, amounting to \u20ac58 billion in investments, progress to production over the next 30 years, Finland's GDP would rise by approximately 1%. Additionally, employment could improve by 12,000 person-years annually, with 40% from the investment phase and 60% from production. The report also forecasts increases in tax revenues, including \u20ac170 million from income taxes, \u20ac40 million from corporate taxes, and \u20ac330 million from property taxes each year. EK emphasizes the need for high-value-added supply chains and the synchronized advancement of interdependent investments.",
