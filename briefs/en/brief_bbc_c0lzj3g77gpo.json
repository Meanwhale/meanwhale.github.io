    "news_text": "The Bank of England has halved its growth forecast for 2025 from 1.5% to 0.75% and cut interest rates to 4.5%. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer expressed dissatisfaction with the current growth and emphasized the government's commitment to improving the economy. The Bank expects inflation to rise to 3.7% due to increased energy and water bills, and it predicts lower growth for the UK economy in the near term. The interest rate cut will benefit homeowners with tracker mortgages but may lead to lower returns for savers.",
