    "news_text": "As the 2024 presidential election approaches, false claims about noncitizens voting in the US are spreading on social media. Posts suggest that individuals can easily cross the border and vote without ID, but these claims are false. Federal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in presidential elections, and while some states allow noncitizen residents to vote in local elections, instances of noncitizen voting are extremely rare. Studies show that noncitizen voting has negligible statistical impact, and recent claims are part of broader efforts to undermine trust in the electoral process.",
