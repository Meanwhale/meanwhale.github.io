    "news_text": "Mark Rutte, the Dutch Prime Minister, congratulated Donald Trump on his election victory and highlighted NATO's role in enhancing US power and security through its 31 allies. Rutte, known for his ability to engage with Trump, noted that NATO members are increasing their defense spending. However, he expressed uncertainty about Trump's commitment to NATO, given Trump's transactional views and potential to undermine the alliance. Concerns also arose regarding Trump's approach to the Ukraine conflict and the implications for US support. European leaders, including French President Macron, are calling for greater EU autonomy in response to the changing dynamics, although experts remain skeptical about the feasibility of achieving this amidst economic challenges and rising nationalism.",
