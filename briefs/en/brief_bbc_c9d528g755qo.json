    "news_text": "Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated there are &#x27;no excuses&#x27; for not building the 1.5 million new homes Labour pledged in its election manifesto. The government aims to meet this target by 2029, but BBC analysis shows new home construction fell during Labour&#x27;s initial months in power. Rayner expressed determination to meet the target despite difficulties, including a chronic shortage of skilled workers and concerns about building materials. The government is also working to streamline the house-buying process and empower leaseholders. Former Conservative MP Gillian Keegan criticized the slow pace of housebuilding, highlighting the challenges faced in recent years.",
