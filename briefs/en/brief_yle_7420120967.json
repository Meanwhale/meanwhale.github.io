    "news_text": "The EU is looking to utilize citizens' savings in bank accounts for investments in growth companies. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to enhance capital markets and encourage long-term investments, particularly in the context of pension funding. Jesper Berg advocates for a funded pension model, which has been successful in countries like the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark. This model allows employees to invest a portion of their future pensions, potentially increasing overall investment in the EU. However, challenges remain, including the need for a significant transition period and the risk of double payments for pensions. The EU's Capital Markets Union aims to eliminate barriers to capital movement, with a pressing need for \u20ac800 billion in investments for defense and climate action. The current reliance on bank financing for companies contrasts with the U.S. model, where capital markets play a more significant role.",
