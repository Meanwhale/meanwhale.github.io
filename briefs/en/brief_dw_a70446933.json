    "news_text": "Saline solution, essential for operations and medical procedures, has become scarce in Germany, with hospitals receiving only 50% of their needs recently. The North Rhine-Westphalian Ministry of Health confirmed supply bottlenecks, worsening the situation for outpatient care. This shortage is part of a broader trend affecting various medications, including antibiotics, leading to concerns about treatment quality. The complexities of drug manufacturing and supply chains, heavily reliant on a few global suppliers, contribute to these shortages. Experts warn that restoring production in the EU is challenging and would take years, leaving the current supply issues unresolved.",
