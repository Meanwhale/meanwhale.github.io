    "news_text": "Saline solution, essential for operations and medical procedures, is currently scarce in German hospitals and pharmacies, with supply levels dropping from 80% to around 50%. This shortage is impacting both inpatient and outpatient care, as confirmed by health authorities. The situation is part of a broader trend of medication shortages in Germany, including antibiotics and children's medications, which has raised concerns about treatment quality. The causes of these shortages are complex, including reliance on global supply chains, limited manufacturers, and economic pressures on drug production. Experts warn that restoring production to the EU would be challenging and time-consuming, with no immediate solutions available for the upcoming winter.",
