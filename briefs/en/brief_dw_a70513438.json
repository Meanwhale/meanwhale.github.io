    "news_text": "On October 20, Prabowo Subianto will be inaugurated as Indonesia's president after winning the February election with a populist campaign focused on economic growth and poverty reduction. Despite Indonesia's past success in reducing extreme poverty, recent data from the Central Bureau of Statistics indicates a significant decline in the middle class, from 57.3 million in 2019 to 47.8 million in March 2024. Economists attribute this decline to lingering effects of the COVID pandemic, rising inflation, and increased tax burdens. The World Bank defines the middle class as economically secure individuals who contribute to national growth through spending. However, many Indonesians express concerns about their financial stability due to rising living costs and diminishing purchasing power, particularly in non-food expenditures. The government plans to increase taxes and prices in 2025, which may further strain the middle class. Analysts warn that without targeted policies, Indonesia risks falling into a middle-income trap, jeopardizing its goal of becoming a high-income country by 2045.",
