    "news_text": "On October 20, Prabowo Subianto will be inaugurated as Indonesia's president after winning a February election with promises of 8% economic growth and poverty reduction. Despite Indonesia's recent economic successes, a World Bank study indicates the need for a larger middle class to achieve high-income status. However, recent data from Indonesia's Central Statistics Agency shows a decline in the middle class from 57.3 million in 2019 to 47.8 million in March 2024, attributed to COVID-19's lingering effects, inflation, and rising taxes. The middle class, crucial for economic growth through spending, is facing decreased purchasing power, forcing them to allocate more budget for food and less for discretionary spending. Future government policies, including tax increases and rising costs for health insurance and transportation, may further strain the middle class. Economists warn that Indonesia risks falling into a middle-income trap, complicating its goal of becoming a high-income country by 2045.",
