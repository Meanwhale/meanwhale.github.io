This marks the first accusation against the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for direct involvement in the camp&#x27;s violence, despite ongoing artillery shelling in the area. The RSF, previously allied with the military, has been blocking access to medical treatment for the wounded. The humanitarian situation is dire, with the camp hosting around half a million displaced people already suffering from famine.",
