    "news_text": "A cholera outbreak in Kosti, a city in southern Sudan, has resulted in nearly 60 deaths and around 1,300 illnesses over three days. Health authorities attribute the outbreak to contaminated drinking water after the local water plant was attacked by a paramilitary group. The health ministry reported that from Thursday to Saturday, 58 people died and 1,293 were affected. In response, officials have initiated a vaccination campaign against cholera. Last year, cholera claimed over 600 lives and sickened more than 21,000 from July to October. The disease is highly contagious, causing severe dehydration and can be fatal without prompt treatment.",
