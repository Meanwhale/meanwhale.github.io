    "news_text": "Both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are not prioritizing US-Africa relations in their presidential campaigns, continuing a trend from previous administrations. Experts note that neither Trump nor Biden focused on Africa during their terms, with Trump reducing US troop levels and introducing the 'Prosper Africa' initiative to compete with China's Belt and Road Initiative. Despite the US being Africa's largest aid donor, China has become the largest trading partner. Analysts emphasize the need for a renewed US policy towards Africa to address issues like military expansion from China and Russia, and to prevent losing influence on the continent. The upcoming elections may not change this dynamic, with both candidates likely to maintain a focus on rivalry with China and Russia rather than a comprehensive strategy for Africa.",
