    "news_text": "Both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are neglecting US-Africa relations in their presidential campaigns, a pattern seen in past administrations. Neither Trump nor Biden focused significantly on Africa during their terms, with Biden planning a visit only now. Experts note that both parties have similar approaches to Africa, which is not a top priority for the US. While the US is Africa's largest aid donor, China has become its largest trading partner. Trump's previous initiatives aimed to compete with China's influence, but his potential reelection may lead to further cuts in foreign aid. The African Growth and Opportunity Act, which expires in 2025, will require renewal, and both candidates may impose conditions based on social policies. The political landscape in Africa is unstable, with military juntas seeking support from Russia, while US military presence has diminished. Analysts predict that regardless of who wins, US policy towards Africa will need significant redesign to prevent losing influence to China and Russia.",
