    "news_text": "Halloween, or All Hallows' Eve, is celebrated on October 31 with children dressing up and asking for candy. Its roots lie in ancient traditions like Samhain and All Saints' Day, but it has become a largely commercial holiday, especially in the US. The celebration spread globally, influenced by Irish immigrants and popular culture, and is now embraced in various forms, including in Germany, where it gained popularity in the 1990s. Despite its commercialization, some traditional aspects remain, though many older Germans still reserve costumes for Carnival.",
