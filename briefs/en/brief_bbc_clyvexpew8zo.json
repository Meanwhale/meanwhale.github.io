    "news_text": "The closure of Marineland Antibes in France has left the future of two killer whales, Wikie and Keijo, uncertain. The zoo's management and campaigners disagree on their relocation, with the French government blocking a proposal to send them to Japan due to concerns over animal welfare. Alternatives include a marine zoo in the Canary Islands, but fears persist about their treatment there. Experts suggest that releasing the orcas into the wild is not feasible, as they were born in captivity. A sanctuary in Nova Scotia has been proposed, which would provide a more natural environment for the whales. The situation reflects a broader movement against marine zoos and captivity.",
