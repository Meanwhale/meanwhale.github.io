    "news_text": "Venezuela's foreign ministry condemned Brazil's decision to veto its admission to the Brics group, labeling it an 'immoral aggression.' This move occurred during a summit in Russia attended by numerous heads of state. Relations between the two countries have deteriorated since Venezuela's disputed presidential election in July, where President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed victory despite evidence suggesting opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez won. Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva initially supported Maduro but later withheld recognition of the election results. The Venezuelan government expressed indignation over Brazil's continued veto, which they attribute to the previous administration's policies. Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged Venezuela's stance but noted that consensus among Brics members is necessary for admission. The Brics group, originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has expanded to include new members, but internal divisions remain, particularly highlighted by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.",
