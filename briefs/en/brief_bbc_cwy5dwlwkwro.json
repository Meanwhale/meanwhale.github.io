    "news_text": "The UK government is proposing new laws to address pollution by water companies, allowing regulators to impose harsher penalties, including prison sentences of up to two years for executives who obstruct investigations. The legislation aims to ban bonuses for executives whose companies fail to meet environmental standards. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the need for accountability among water company leaders, but some campaigners criticized the measures as insufficient, arguing that they do not address systemic issues within the regulatory framework. The legislation follows widespread criticism of water companies for polluting waterways while paying executives large bonuses. Water UK acknowledged the need for reform and called for support for a significant investment plan to improve infrastructure. Further legislative measures are anticipated to enhance the effectiveness of the water industry.",
