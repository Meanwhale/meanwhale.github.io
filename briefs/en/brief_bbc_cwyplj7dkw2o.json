    "news_original_title": "Subsidies halved for controversial Drax power station",
    "news_text": "The UK government has agreed on a new funding arrangement with the Drax power station, which will cut subsidies in half and ensure that 100% of the wood pellets burned are sustainably sourced. Drax, a controversial wood-burning power station, generates about 5% of the UK&#x27;s electricity but has faced criticism for its CO2 emissions. The new deal will run from 2027 to 2031, allowing Drax to serve as a backup to cheaper renewable sources. The government predicts a reduction in subsidies from nearly \u00a31 billion to \u00a3470 million. Critics, including Greenpeace, have called the deal a compromise but hope it will limit Drax&#x27;s operations. Drax claims the new arrangement will save consumers money and help balance the electricity system.",
