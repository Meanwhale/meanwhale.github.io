    "news_text": "The UK government, led by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, has promised not to raise taxes on 'working people' in the forthcoming Budget. However, the definition of 'working people' is unclear. Sir Keir Starmer defines them as those who earn a living through work and cannot rely on additional income from assets. Conversely, Reeves describes them as 'strivers who graft,' focusing on hardworking families. There is debate over whether landlords and business owners qualify as working people, with various ministers avoiding clear answers. Concerns have been raised that raising National Insurance contributions could breach the government's pledge. Ultimately, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King warns that any significant tax increase will affect the overall economy and spending power of the populace.",
