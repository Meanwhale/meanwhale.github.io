    "news_text": "As people age, their functional capacity is influenced by physical fitness, cognitive abilities, relationships, and other factors. Resilience plays a crucial role in overcoming challenges, with good functional capacity stemming from various life experiences. Koivunen describes this capacity as a system where different components interact closely. Her research highlights that resilience in older adults includes not just mental resources but also physical strength and environmental support. The study found that the interconnectedness of functional capacity components increases with age and perceived health decline, leading to potential chain reactions in the ecosystem of a person's abilities. The research indicates that older individuals today have better physical and cognitive capacities than those of the same age three decades ago. Future research aims to identify early warning signs of functional decline to better support older adults in maintaining their abilities as they age.",
