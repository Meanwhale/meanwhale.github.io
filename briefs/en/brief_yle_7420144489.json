    "news_text": "The cost of basic income support increased by nearly EUR 100 million last year, despite the number of households receiving it remaining stable. Kela paid EUR 825 million in 2024, with an average monthly support of EUR 528. Cuts in social benefits and the influx of displaced Ukrainians contributed to this rise. Over 155,000 households receiving support were single-person households, highlighting economic vulnerability among low-income individuals.",
