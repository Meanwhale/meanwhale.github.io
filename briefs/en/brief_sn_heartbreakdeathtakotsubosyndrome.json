    "news_text": "Takotsubo syndrome, also known as broken heart syndrome, is a temporary heart condition often triggered by extreme emotional or physical stress. It primarily affects postmenopausal women and can lead to symptoms similar to a heart attack, despite the heart's arteries being clear. The syndrome is named after a Japanese word for a type of octopus trap, as the left ventricle takes on a balloon-like shape. While it can be severe, most patients recover quickly, often within days, raising questions about the necessity of aggressive medical treatment. The phenomenon has been documented since the 1960s, and some historical cases of sudden death from grief may have been instances of takotsubo syndrome.",
