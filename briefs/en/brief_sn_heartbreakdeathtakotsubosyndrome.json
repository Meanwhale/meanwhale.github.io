    "news_text": "Takotsubo syndrome, also known as 'broken heart syndrome', is a temporary heart condition that can occur after extreme emotional or physical stress. It primarily affects postmenopausal women and is characterized by a ballooning of the left ventricle. While it can be triggered by traumatic events, the exact cause remains unclear. Despite its severity, most patients recover within days, and the condition is often misdiagnosed as a heart attack. The phenomenon has been documented since the 1960s, and it raises questions about the nature of grief and its physiological effects on the heart.",
