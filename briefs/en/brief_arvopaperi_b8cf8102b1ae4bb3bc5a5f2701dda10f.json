    "news_text": "Lindex Group reported a slight improvement in its adjusted operating result for the last quarter, reaching EUR 36.1 million compared to EUR 30.2 million the previous year. However, the overall annual performance was challenging, with a decrease in the adjusted operating result to EUR 74.9 million from EUR 80.0 million. The company's turnover for the last quarter was EUR 273.7 million, slightly down from EUR 274.3 million the previous year. The CEO noted that decreased purchasing power and low consumer confidence negatively impacted demand. Lindex is undergoing a restructuring program and does not distribute dividends. The company anticipates modest growth in net sales for 2024 and is exploring alternatives for its Stockmann department store business.",
