    "news_text": "At the beginning of the year, employment services were transferred from the state to municipalities, leading to congestion and challenges in service delivery. Local authorities faced issues like backlogs in information systems and changes in working conditions. While some employees appreciated improved workspaces, many expressed disappointment over increased working hours without additional pay. The economic situation tightened, limiting wage support and recruitment efforts. Despite these challenges, the transition is seen positively as it allows for more localized services for job seekers. In Meri Lapland, initial job seeker interviews are conducted quickly, but budget constraints have reduced available services. Overall, the first year of this transition is focused on adapting to new structures within municipal budgets.",
