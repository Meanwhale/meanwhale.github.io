    "news_header": "Piippo oyj is undergoing negotiations that may result in up to 53 redundancies. The company has signed a letter of intent to sell its baling net and yarn machines to Cotesi in Portugal for approximately EUR 6 million, leading to the cessation of production in Outokumpu by year-end. Although the Piippo trademark will be sold, the company itself will remain listed, along with its other assets. The move aims to improve Piippo&#x27;s financial situation, which has been struggling due to weak price competition and oversupply. A General Meeting will decide on the letter of intent by the end of March, and a new strategy will be developed post-agreement.",
