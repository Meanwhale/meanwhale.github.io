    "news_text": "The South African Foreign Ministry announced that Taiwan must move its unofficial embassy, the Taipei Liaison Office, from Pretoria to Johannesburg within six months. This decision reflects the non-political nature of South Africa's relationship with Taiwan, which has been informal since formal ties were severed in 1997. The Taiwanese government expressed concern over the move, indicating it would consider responses to protect its sovereignty. Meanwhile, China welcomed South Africa's decision, highlighting the ongoing tensions between Beijing and Taipei, especially following recent military drills by China around Taiwan.",
