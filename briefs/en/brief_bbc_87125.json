    "news_text": "As the US presidential election approaches, young voters are gaining significant attention from both parties, primarily due to economic concerns such as inflation and housing affordability. Many first-time voters, like 21-year-old Isabella Morris, express uncertainty about their candidate choice but prioritize economic issues over other topics like reproductive rights and gun violence. Surveys indicate that voters aged 18-26 rank economic growth and income inequality as their top concerns, contrasting with previous elections where health and social issues were more prominent. Both presidential candidates, Trump and Harris, are intensifying their economic messages to appeal to this demographic, with Harris focusing on initiatives like student loan forgiveness and housing subsidies, while Trump emphasizes economic dissatisfaction under the current administration. Young candidates are also emerging, motivated by the economic challenges faced by their generation. Experts predict a turnout of about 50% among young voters, similar to the 2020 election, highlighting the importance of addressing economic hardships to engage this critical voting bloc.",
