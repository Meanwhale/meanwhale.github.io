    "news_text": "The Casarabe people of ancient South America transformed seasonal savannas into productive maize farming areas by creating an intricate network of drainage canals and ponds. This innovation allowed them to harvest maize twice a year, supporting the growth of their urban society between 500 and 1400 AD. Researchers used satellite imagery and ground surveys to identify these water management systems, which were crucial for sustaining a large population with reliable food sources.",
