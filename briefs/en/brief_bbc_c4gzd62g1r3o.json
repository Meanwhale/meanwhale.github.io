    "news_text": "Australia's government, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, is set to introduce legislation banning children under 16 from social media to address concerns about online safety. The proposed laws, to be discussed in parliament next week, aim to mitigate the harm social media can cause to young people. While the ban won't affect those already using social media, it will not allow exemptions for parental consent. The eSafety Commissioner will enforce the laws, which will take effect a year after passing. Experts are divided on the effectiveness of such bans, with some advocating for safety standards instead. Advocacy groups have expressed concerns that the ban may be too blunt, while others argue it is necessary to protect children from harmful online content.",
