    "news_text": "The school health survey aims to understand the well-being of youth, but it should not be conflated with scientific research. While the survey has evolved to include more questions about mental health, its findings should be interpreted with caution. Anxiety, for instance, is a common human experience and not necessarily indicative of a mental disorder. The survey's results can inform welfare strategies, but the complexities of mental health issues require careful analysis to avoid unnecessary alarm. The survey's development by Matti Rimpel\u00e4 was a social innovation, but its current relevance and effectiveness are questioned. The media often sensationalizes findings, which can lead to confusion about the actual state of youth mental health. Overall, there is a need for clarity in discussions about mental health trends and the implications of survey results.",
