    "news_text": "During Donald Trump's first presidential term, he faced many obstacles, but in his second term, he has a stronger grip on the Republican Party and is better positioned to fulfill his promises. The Republican Party has shifted from traditional conservatism to Trumpist populism, and many former opponents have left politics. Trump's administration is preparing to implement a detailed plan, Project 2025, aimed at increasing presidential power and replacing officials with loyalists. The Supreme Court's conservative majority may protect Trump from legal challenges, allowing him to pursue his political agenda without fear of repercussions.",
