    "news_text": "According to UK Finance, fraud cases have risen by 16%, with criminals stealing more than \u00a33 million a day, particularly targeting victims for their one-time passcodes. Although reported cases increased, total losses fell slightly to \u00a3572 million in the first half of the year. Banks have called for support to address the growing threat of fraud. Recent data showed a rise in unauthorized payments, while romance and investment scams saw declines, possibly due to new regulations on authorized push payment (APP) fraud. Mandatory rules effective October 7 will require banks to refund APP fraud victims up to \u00a385,000 within five days. UK Finance emphasized the serious psychological impact of fraud on victims, and Lloyds Banking Group's CEO criticized Meta for enabling online scams, while Meta responded with its Fraud Intelligence Reciprocal Exchange program to enhance collaboration with banks.",
