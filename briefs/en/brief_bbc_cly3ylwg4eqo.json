    "news_text": "Facing international isolation due to the Ukraine invasion and sanctions, Vladimir Putin is hosting the Brics summit in Kazan with over 20 heads of state, including leaders from China, India, and Iran. The Kremlin portrays this event as evidence that attempts to isolate Russia have failed, highlighting the growing influence of the Brics nations, which represent 45% of the global population and 28% of the global economy. Putin aims to encourage Brics members to develop alternatives to the US dollar for trade, addressing economic challenges linked to Western sanctions. However, internal differences among Brics members, such as tensions between China and India, and Iran and Saudi Arabia, may hinder unified action. Despite these challenges, Putin seeks to project an image of solidarity and resilience to both the Russian public and the international community.",
