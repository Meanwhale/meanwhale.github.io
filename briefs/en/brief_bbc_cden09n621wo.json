    "news_text": "In a significant underground courtroom trial in France, Judge Arabelle Bouts presides over a case involving a Kurdish smuggling gang accused of facilitating migrant crossings across the Channel. Mirkhan Rasoul, already serving time for previous offenses, faces additional charges after threatening courtroom translators. The prosecution, led by Julie Carros, outlines the gang's operations, which reportedly generated substantial profits by overloading small boats. The trial includes 17 defendants, with severe sentences being sought. Prosecutors aim to deter smuggling activities through these measures, but defense lawyers express skepticism about their effectiveness, noting that many leaders remain elusive and that harsh penalties may not dissuade those involved in the lucrative smuggling trade.",
