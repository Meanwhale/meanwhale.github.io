    "news_text": "California has enacted the School Food Safety Act, prohibiting the use of six synthetic food dyes in public schools starting in 2028, amid concerns about their potential link to neurobehavioral issues such as ADHD in children. While some studies suggest a connection, the FDA maintains that there is insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship. The ban has sparked protests against companies like Kellogg for not removing these dyes from their products. Experts argue that the ban will enhance safety in schools and may encourage other states to take similar actions.",
