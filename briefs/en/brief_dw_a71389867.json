    "news_text": "A corpse flower at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney has drawn over 20,000 visitors for its rare bloom, the first since 2010. Native to Sumatra, the flower emits a strong odor to attract insects for pollination. The flower, named 'Putricia', blooms inconsistently, often only once a decade. Botanists are working to hand-pollinate it due to the rarity of its blooming and the decline of corpse flowers in the wild, with only about 300 remaining.",
