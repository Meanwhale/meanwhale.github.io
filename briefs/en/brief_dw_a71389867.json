    "news_text": "A corpse flower in the Royal Botanic Gardens of Sydney has drawn more than 20,000 visitors due to its rare bloom, which hasn't occurred since 2010. Known for its foul odor resembling decaying meat, the flower is native to Sumatra and is named 'Putricia'. The blooming process is infrequent, often occurring once a decade, and relies on the flower's energy reserves. Pollination requires nearby flowers to bloom simultaneously, and efforts are being made to hand-pollinate Putricia. The number of corpse flowers in the wild has declined, with only about 300 remaining.",
