    "news_text": "The Tameryraptor markgraf fossils have a tragic history, having been largely destroyed during WWII. Discovered in the Sahara, these ancient bones represent a predator that hadn't seen the light of day for millions of years. The story begins in the early 1910s with German paleontologist Ernst Stromer, who identified the Spinosaurus from fossils found in Egypt. Despite the challenges of war and the loss of many fossils, new research has revealed that the bones collected by Richard Markgraf belong to a previously unknown species, now named Tameryraptor markgraf. This species is believed to be related to the Carcharodontosaurus and highlights the rich diversity of dinosaurs in North Africa.",
