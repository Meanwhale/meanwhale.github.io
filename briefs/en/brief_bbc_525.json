    "news_text": "Recent floods in Central Europe, exacerbated by climate change, have resulted in at least 24 deaths and significant damage across several countries. The World Weather Attribution group noted that the recent storm, Boris, brought unprecedented rainfall, made more likely by climate change. While the storm was well-forecast, allowing for better preparedness, scientists warn that similar extreme weather events will become more frequent and intense as global temperatures rise. Current climate trends indicate that Europe is warming faster than any other continent, leading to increased heatwaves and heavy rainfall. Improved flood defenses have mitigated some impacts, but experts caution that without significant emission reductions, future flood events could become increasingly severe.",
