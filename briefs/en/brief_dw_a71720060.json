    "news_text": "Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi announced plans to initiate discussions for a unity government as international pressure grows to address the ongoing crisis in eastern Congo. The M23 rebels, allegedly backed by approximately 4,000 Rwandan troops, have intensified their insurgency, capturing key cities like Goma and Bukavu, resulting in significant casualties. Tshisekedi acknowledged the need for unity, stating he would reach out to all political factions, including the opposition, despite previously dismissing dialogue with the rebels. The UN Security Council has called for an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of M23 forces, emphasizing that there is no military solution to the conflict. The situation raises fears of a broader regional war, with the M23 claiming to protect certain ethnic groups while Congo accuses them of exploiting the country&#x27;s resources.",
