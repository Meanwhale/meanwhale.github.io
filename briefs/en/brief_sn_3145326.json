    "news_text": "Using lidar technology, archaeologists have identified two ancient cities, Tugunbulak and Tashbulak, located over 2,000 meters above sea level in southeastern Uzbekistan. These settlements, previously obscured by erosion and vegetation, demonstrate that mountainous Central Asia was an urban zone during medieval times. Tugunbulak, one of the largest cities of its time, featured over 300 structures, including a fortress and defensive walls, while Tashbulak, smaller but still significant, had at least 98 structures. The findings challenge the notion that mountains hinder trade, suggesting instead that they facilitated cultural and economic exchanges. The populations likely relied on highland pastures for livestock and traded for cultivated foods from lowland areas. The research highlights the adaptability and urban capabilities of high-altitude herding communities.",
