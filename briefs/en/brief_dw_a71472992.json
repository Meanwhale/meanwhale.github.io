    "news_original_title": "US health agency approves brand-new painkiller",
    "news_text": "The FDA has approved a new painkiller named suzetrigine, which targets nerves outside the brain to block pain signals. Unlike traditional painkillers, it does not act on opioid receptors, reducing the risk of addiction and side effects. Vertex Pharmaceuticals, the drug's manufacturer, claims it effectively alleviates moderate to severe pain, marking a significant advancement in pain management. The approval follows successful clinical trials, and while it is more expensive than common painkillers, it offers a safer alternative for acute pain relief. Ongoing studies are assessing its effectiveness for chronic neuropathic pain.",
