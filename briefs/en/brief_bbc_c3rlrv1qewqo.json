    "news_text": "China held a live-firing exercise near Taiwan following a large-scale military drill encircling the island, intensifying its claims over the self-governed territory. The Chinese military announced a four-hour drill around Niushan, prompting Taiwan's premier to criticize the exercises as a threat to regional stability. While Taiwan considers the drills routine, analysts view them as a message from China amidst a broader campaign of incursions into Taiwanese territory. In response, US allies have increased naval patrols in the Taiwan Strait, signaling support for Taiwan. Despite the heightened tensions, a US official indicated a desire to lower tensions with Beijing, while China continues to assert its claims over Taiwan, especially following Taiwanese President William Lai's recent remarks on sovereignty.",
