    "news_original_title": "Israel confirms Shiri Bibas body has been returned",
    "news_text": "Israel&#x27;s forensic officials confirmed that the body handed over by Hamas is that of Shiri Bibas, but they rejected claims that she was killed by Israeli bombing. Dr. Chen Kugel stated that there was no evidence of injuries from bombing. The Bibas family expressed sorrow over their loss, stating that Shiri was murdered in captivity. Hamas had previously claimed that Shiri and her children were killed by Israeli airstrikes. The remains of Shiri&#x27;s children were also handed over, but forensic tests revealed that one body was misidentified. The ongoing conflict has seen significant casualties, with Israel&#x27;s military campaign resulting in over 48,000 Palestinian deaths since the October 7 attacks, which killed around 1,200 people in Israel.",
