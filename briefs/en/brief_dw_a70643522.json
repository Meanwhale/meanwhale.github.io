    "news_text": "The European Chemicals Agency reported that a pilot enforcement project revealed that about 6% of nearly 4,500 inspected cosmetic products contained hazardous substances prohibited under EU regulations. The inspections, conducted by national enforcement agencies in 13 EEA member states, identified banned substances in 285 products. The project focused on chemicals restricted by the POPs and REACH regulations. The ECHA emphasized that consumers should be aware of these substances in various cosmetic products across different price ranges. Initial steps have been taken to remove non-compliant products from the market, and investigations are ongoing. The ECHA specifically looked for PFOA, PFCAs, and cyclic siloxanes D4 and D5, which are harmful to health and the environment.",
