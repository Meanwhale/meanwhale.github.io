    "news_text": "On Monday afternoon, market rates experienced small movements, with long-term government debt interest rates slightly positive. The interest rate on a 10-year US loan was 0.6%, while the two-year loan rate dropped to 1.0%. Gold prices rose to a new record, exceeding $2,900 per ounce. President Trump announced plans to impose 25% import duties on aluminium and steel, raising concerns about inflation and its potential impact on the central bank&#x27;s interest rate policy. The market is awaiting US inflation figures and producer price index data later this week. Additionally, the Japanese yen weakened against other currencies.",
