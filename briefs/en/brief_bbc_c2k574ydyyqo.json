    "news_original_title": "Trump signs order shifting US back toward plastic straws",
    "news_text": "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that ends the government&#x27;s initiative to replace plastic straws with paper ones, reversing a measure implemented by former President Joe Biden. Trump criticized paper straws for being ineffective and called for a nationwide strategy to eliminate them. This order comes as part of a broader debate on plastic pollution, with Biden&#x27;s administration previously planning to phase out single-use plastics by 2027. Trump, who sold branded plastic straws during his campaign, has been a long-time critic of paper straws, claiming they dissolve quickly and do not perform well.",
