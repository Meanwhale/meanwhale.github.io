    "news_original_title": "Like flyways for birds, we need to map swimways for fish",
    "news_text": "Freshwater fish migrations are largely unseen but vital for ecosystem health. Over 80% of migratory fish populations have declined since 1970 due to habitat fragmentation, pollution, and overfishing. Researchers are mapping these hidden routes to aid conservation and infrastructure planning. The Mekong River, home to many migratory species, faces threats from dam construction, which disrupts these pathways. Efforts like the Global Swimways Initiative aim to enhance understanding of fish migrations, emphasizing the need for international cooperation in river management.",
