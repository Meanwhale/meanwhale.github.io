    "news_text": "Research on 100 survivors of the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks shows that recovery from PTSD involves significant changes in how the brain processes memories. The study, published in Science Advances, indicates that individuals who developed PTSD exhibited distinct brain activity patterns when suppressing intrusive memories. Over time, those who recovered showed brain activity more similar to individuals without PTSD. The findings suggest that PTSD may be viewed as a forgetting disorder rather than solely a learning disorder, highlighting the brain's ability to adapt and recover.",
