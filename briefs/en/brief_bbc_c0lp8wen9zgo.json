    "news_text": "Georgians are acutely aware of the repercussions of Russia's military actions, particularly the 2008 war. In the upcoming election, opposition groups are framing the vote as a critical decision between aligning with Russia or pursuing European Union membership, aiming to end the 12-year rule of the Georgian Dream party, which they accuse of drifting towards Russia. The ruling party, led by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, denies this framing, claiming to be the party of peace. Concerns over Georgia's security, the EU's stalled integration process, and recent laws targeting media and LGBT rights have raised doubts about the country's commitment to European values. The election has also seen tensions surrounding the opposition, with Ivanishvili promising to ban the largest opposition party. While some voters in regions like Gori remember the past with Russia, there is a general consensus that Georgia's future lies with the EU, though uncertainty remains about who will facilitate that path.",
