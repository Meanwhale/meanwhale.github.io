    "news_text": "In the context of Georgia's historical conflicts with Russia, the upcoming election is seen as a crucial decision point for the nation, with opposition groups emphasizing the need to choose between Russia and Europe. The ruling party, Georgian Dream (GD), led by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, is accused of moving closer to Russia, while the opposition seeks to revive Georgia's stalled EU membership aspirations. The election is marked by tensions surrounding the legacy of the 2008 war, voter intimidation, and controversial laws affecting civil liberties. Despite GD's promises for EU integration by 2030, skepticism remains due to recent legislative actions and the perception that Georgia is distancing itself from Europe. The election's outcome could significantly impact Georgia's geopolitical alignment and future prospects.",
