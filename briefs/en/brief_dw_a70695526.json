    "news_text": "Elise Thomas, an open-source intelligence researcher, discovered several accounts on social media platform X that utilize generative artificial intelligence to promote support for Donald Trump. Her investigation revealed that many of these accounts were verified and displayed typical signs of spam networks, such as using outdated hashtags and self-referential posts. Some accounts even engaged in arguments with themselves, indicating a sophisticated network that may have bypassed OpenAI's safeguards. Thomas noted that the accounts were suspended quickly after her findings were shared, but she emphasized the challenge of attributing such automated networks to specific individuals or groups. This situation highlights the growing complexity of identifying disinformation campaigns as AI technology evolves.",
