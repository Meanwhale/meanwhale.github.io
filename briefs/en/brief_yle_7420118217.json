    "news_text": "The number of flights departing from Finland and arriving in the summer has risen by over 10% compared to last year, according to Fintraffic. Domestic flights saw a slightly lower increase, while overflights in Finnish airspace also grew by more than 10%, particularly due to an uptick in operations by Chinese airlines from July to September. Domestic traffic is focusing on longer distances, and Fintraffic anticipates that air traffic in Lapland will return to pre-corona levels.",
