    "news_header": "The UK government has confirmed that it will not increase income tax or National Insurance rates ahead of the upcoming Budget, but hints at potential increases in employer National Insurance to address a \u00a322bn deficit.",
    "news_text": "As the UK government prepares for the Budget on 30 October, it has announced that the main rates for income tax and National Insurance (NI) will remain unchanged. However, Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer have suggested a possible increase in the employer NI rate to address a \u00a322bn shortfall in public finances. Although the NI rate for workers and the self-employed was cut in 2024, many individuals are still paying more overall due to changes in tax calculations and frozen thresholds. The government relies on NI contributions to fund benefits and the NHS, with various rates applicable to employees, employers, and the self-employed. The income tax structure remains complex, with different rates based on earnings, and the freezing of thresholds means more individuals will pay taxes as wages rise. Overall, the UK's tax burden is high compared to historical rates, with projections indicating it could reach its highest level in 80 years by 2028-29.",
