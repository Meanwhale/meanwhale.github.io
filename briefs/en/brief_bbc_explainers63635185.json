    "news_text": "As the UK government prepares for the Budget on October 30, it has confirmed that it will maintain the current rates of income tax and National Insurance (NI). However, Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer have suggested potential increases in the employer NI rate to address a \u00a322bn shortfall in public finances. While worker and self-employed NI rates were reduced in 2024, many individuals are still facing higher overall tax burdens due to frozen thresholds for tax and NI contributions. The government aims to raise \u00a320bn, and speculation surrounds possible changes to NI contributions on pension payments. The current tax structure includes various rates for income tax and NI, with implications for different income brackets. The freezing of thresholds until 2028 means more individuals will pay taxes as wages rise, potentially negating the benefits of recent NI cuts.",
