    "news_text": "Indonesia's Constitutional Court recently dismissed a legal effort to recognize atheists and nonbelievers, ruling that citizens must declare a faith on official documents. The court's decision reinforces the requirement for marriage to conform to religious laws and maintains that atheism is not recognized under Indonesian law. Despite some hopes for change, the court ruled that religious belief is essential under the country's founding ideology, Pancasila. This ruling has drawn little international attention, and while atheism is stigmatized, research indicates a significant number of nonbelievers in Indonesia. Activists continue to seek recognition and rights for atheists amidst rising religious fundamentalism.",
