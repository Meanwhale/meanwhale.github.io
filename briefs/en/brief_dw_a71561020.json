    "news_text": "After a record-breaking year for tourist arrivals in 2024, Japan is preparing for another peak in visitors. While the travel industry benefits from post-pandemic tourism, citizens express frustration over overcrowding and disruptive behavior by tourists in key cities like Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka. Incidents of disrespect towards cultural sites have raised concerns. Cities like Kyoto are implementing measures to manage tourism, including a Tourism Code of Conduct and express buses to alleviate congestion. Experts suggest Japan should learn from global overtourism issues and encourage visitors to explore rural areas. The government aims for 60 million arrivals by the decade&#x27;s end, raising alarms about sustainability.",
