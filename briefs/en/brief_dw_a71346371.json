    "news_text": "Earworms, or involuntary musical imagery (INMI), are catchy tunes that get stuck in our heads, often without us choosing them. They can be triggered by thoughts, moods, or external cues like daily routines. Despite their annoying nature, many people enjoy earworms. They are typically short, repetitive segments of songs that our brains can easily recall. Emotional responses to music play a significant role in why certain songs become earworms. Interestingly, lyrics are not always necessary for a song to become an earworm, as non-lyrical parts can also be memorable. To get rid of earworms, distractions or completing the song can help.",
