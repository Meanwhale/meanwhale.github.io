    "news_text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cautioned that a widespread trade war among major economies could lead to a contraction of the global economy by nearly 7%, which is comparable to the combined size of the French and German economies. This warning comes amid rising concerns about the potential re-election of Donald Trump, who has proposed a universal tax or tariff of up to 20% on all US imports. The European Union is preparing to retaliate against such measures. IMF Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath emphasized that the use of extensive tariffs would significantly alter the economic landscape, and she urged countries to strengthen their fiscal positions in anticipation of future crises. Despite these challenges, she noted that the world economy has shown resilience, managing to reduce inflation without causing high unemployment, which is a positive outcome for central banks.",
