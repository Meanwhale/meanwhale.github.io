    "news_text": "Researchers are training African giant pouched rats to identify illegal wildlife products such as pangolin scales and elephant ivory. These rats, equipped with an exceptional sense of smell, could help combat wildlife trafficking at ports. The training involves teaching the rats to distinguish specific scents and signal their findings.
