    "news_text": "The Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) aims to produce fusion energy for the electricity grid by the early 2030s, with a test device expected to be ready by 2027. However, Finnish experts caution that the price of fusion electricity may remain high and continuous operation of the plant could be challenging. The project is seen as a significant advancement in energy technology, comparable to the Wright brothers' first flight. CFS plans to build a pilot plant in Massachusetts and a larger facility in Virginia, capable of powering 150,000 homes. Despite optimism, experts express concerns about practical challenges, including material sustainability and the high cost of tritium production. The urgency for fusion energy is underscored by the need to combat climate change, although current reductions in CO2 emissions have primarily come from fission-based nuclear power.",
