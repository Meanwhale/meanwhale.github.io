    "news_text": "Before the first poliovirus vaccine was developed in 1955, polio caused significant paralysis and death. By 2000, vaccination campaigns nearly eradicated wild poliovirus, with only Afghanistan and Pakistan remaining affected. In 2023, Pakistan was close to eradicating polio but saw a resurgence in cases due to spillover from Afghanistan, where vaccination efforts face challenges due to the Taliban's restrictions and public health issues. Zulfiqar Bhutta emphasizes the need for strategic reviews of immunization programs and collaboration with the Taliban to effectively combat polio and improve overall health for women and children in the region.",
