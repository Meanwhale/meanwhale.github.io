    "news_text": "Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), stated that Israel is preventing humanitarian missions from delivering essential supplies to northern Gaza, where hospitals are without power and overcrowded shelters force displaced individuals to live in unsanitary conditions. Reports indicate that civilians attempting to flee are being killed, while the Israeli military intensifies its offensive against Hamas fighters. Despite claims of facilitating evacuations and ensuring hospital operations, accounts from medics and local media reveal casualties from Israeli artillery strikes on displaced persons' camps. The UN has faced challenges in delivering aid, with a recent trickle of supplies allowed through after international pressure. The humanitarian situation is critical, with hospitals overwhelmed and basic necessities like food and water in short supply. The ongoing conflict has resulted in significant loss of life, with over 42,000 reported deaths in Gaza since the escalation began.",
