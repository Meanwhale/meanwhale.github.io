    "news_text": "In October, US job growth significantly decreased as hurricanes and strikes impacted the economy, with only 12,000 jobs added compared to 223,000 in September. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.1%. The Labor Department noted ongoing growth in healthcare and government sectors, but manufacturing jobs fell by 46,000, largely due to strikes at Boeing and Textron. Despite the slowdown, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve are anticipated. The job growth over the past year has also slowed, with average hourly earnings rising by 4%.",
