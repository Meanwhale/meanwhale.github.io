    "news_text": "Norwegian energy company Equinor plans to reduce its investments in renewable energy from about $10 billion to $5 billion over the next two years, while increasing oil and gas production by 10%. CEO Anders Opedal cited a slower transition to low-carbon energy, increased costs, and customer hesitance for this decision. Despite a recent court ruling regarding the Rosebank oil field, which is expected to hold 500 million barrels of oil, Opedal remains confident in its development, emphasizing its importance for local jobs and the UK economy. Climate activists express concerns about the environmental impact and the future of energy security in the UK.",
