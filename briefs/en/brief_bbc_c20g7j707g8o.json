    "news_text": "New research reveals that 2,000 years ago, women in Britain passed on land and wealth to their daughters rather than sons, suggesting that communities were built around women's bloodlines. DNA evidence from skeletons in Dorset indicates that Celtic men moved to live with their wives' families, creating a matrilocal society where women held considerable influence. This is the first documentation of such communities in ancient European history. The study found that most women in these communities were related through maternal lines, while men came from diverse families. The findings challenge the notion that powerful women were an anomaly in ancient societies and suggest that Iron Age Britain was more egalitarian than contemporary Rome.",
