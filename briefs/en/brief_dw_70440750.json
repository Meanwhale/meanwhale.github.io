    "news_text": "According to a poll by the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, 67.8% of Taiwanese respondents expressed willingness to defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack, while 23.6% would not. Nearly 64% view China's territorial ambitions as a serious threat, yet 61% believe an invasion is unlikely in the next five years. Additionally, 52% trust that the United States would assist Taiwan in the event of an invasion, but only 40% think the US would intervene against a blockade. The poll was released ahead of Taiwan's National Day and amidst ongoing military drills by China, which claims Taiwan as its territory.",
