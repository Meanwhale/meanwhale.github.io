    "news_text": "More than a dozen US states have filed a lawsuit against TikTok, alleging that the platform exacerbates a mental health crisis among teenagers by using addictive features and misrepresenting the safety of prolonged use. The lawsuit, led by a bipartisan group of 14 attorneys general, highlights incidents of harm linked to TikTok challenges and claims that the app disrupts sleep and promotes unrealistic beauty standards. TikTok has responded by calling the lawsuit 'disappointing' and asserting that many claims are inaccurate. The lawsuit seeks to prevent TikTok from continuing these practices and demands financial penalties. This legal action adds to TikTok's existing challenges, including a potential ban in the US and previous lawsuits related to child safety and privacy violations.",
