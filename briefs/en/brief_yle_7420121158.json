    "news_text": "Donald Trump has announced plans to impose significant tariffs on foreign goods, which could lead to increased unemployment and economic uncertainty. If he becomes the next President of the United States, the world may face a trade war. Trump has previously emphasized tariffs as a central part of his economic policy, particularly targeting Chinese imports with tariffs as high as 60%. The potential impact on Finland includes higher prices for goods, reduced exports to the U.S., and broader economic repercussions. Economists warn that Trump's trade policies could slow down investments in Europe and negatively affect global economic growth. The uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies may also influence consumer confidence and interest rates in Finland.",
