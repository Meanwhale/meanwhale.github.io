    "news_text": "In a cabinet reshuffle announced late Wednesday, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu dismissed five ministers and appointed seven new ones, including positions for humanitarian affairs, trade, labor, and livestock development. Ten other ministers were reassigned to different portfolios as part of efforts to enhance government efficiency. The reshuffle occurs against a backdrop of increasing economic hardship, protests, and high inflation, exacerbated by Tinubu's recent economic reforms, including currency devaluation and subsidy cuts. The Ministry of Niger Delta Development has been renamed, the Sports Ministry has been closed, and tourism and arts and culture ministries have merged. Despite Nigeria's oil wealth, the country faces significant poverty, and recent flooding has affected over 1.2 million people, worsening the humanitarian situation.",
