    "news_text": "On October 1, Iran fired 180 missiles into Israel, escalating tensions and causing global oil prices to rise by about 5%. Brent crude traded above $75 per barrel following Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's vow of retaliation, raising fears of further conflict in a region crucial for oil supply. Analysts warn that a major escalation could involve the U.S. and disrupt oil exports, particularly from Iran, which, despite sanctions, continues to sell oil, mainly to China. Iran's economic situation is precarious, with a declining currency and significant corruption, while its GDP per capita is far lower than Israel's. The potential for war with Israel poses a significant economic risk for Iran, which could lead to increased public dissatisfaction.",
