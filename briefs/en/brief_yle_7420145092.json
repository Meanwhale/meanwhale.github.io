    "news_text": "Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate, announced that he will not seek re-election, marking the end of his nearly 20-year leadership. Having served since January 1985, the 83-year-old senator&#x27;s current term expires in January 2027. McConnell has faced health challenges in recent years, including hospitalizations due to falls. He played a pivotal role in opposing President Obama and supporting Donald Trump&#x27;s rise to the presidency in 2016. However, their relationship soured after Trump&#x27;s unfounded claims of election fraud in 2020. Despite this, McConnell has continued to advocate for U.S. military aid to Ukraine amid ongoing conflict with Russia.",
