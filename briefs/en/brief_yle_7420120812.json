Since last Friday, defects in the themion system have impacted the availability of fresh products. This led to a surge in demand for other manufacturing salads at S Group stores over the weekend. Fresh yl\u00f6svant identified the fault during the weekend, and deliveries are now back on track, with full normalization expected by the end of the week. Fresh pahoivant has apologized for the inconveniences caused.",
