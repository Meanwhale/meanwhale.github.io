    "news_text": "CNN sources indicate that President Putin views discussions with the U.S. as a chance to reestablish Russia&#x27;s global standing. Despite claims from President Trump that Putin seeks to cease hostilities and does not aim to control all of Ukraine, intelligence sources suggest otherwise. They believe Putin&#x27;s ultimate goal is to integrate Ukraine into Russia or weaken it to a point of dependency. A ceasefire, if achieved, would merely allow Putin to regroup and prepare for future actions. There are no signs of a shift in his objectives, and he seems to perceive himself as still winning the conflict, albeit at a slower pace. The Russian economy is reportedly capable of sustaining military efforts for another year, with no significant incentives for concessions to Ukraine.",
