    "news_text": "The European Commission, led by President Ursula von der Leyen, has introduced a policy roadmap called Competitive Compass to reduce regulatory burdens, access European savings for investment, and support companies in emerging technologies like AI and clean tech. The plan aims to simplify regulations for businesses, especially smaller firms, and create a new category of mid-sized companies to ease their regulatory load. It also addresses high energy prices and aims to maintain industrial competitiveness while promoting green technologies. Critics argue that the plan may undermine important regulations and call for stronger climate action.",
