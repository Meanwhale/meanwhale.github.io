    "news_text": "SSAB's operating profit fell to SEK 7.9 billion from SEK 16.5 billion the previous year, with net sales dropping to SEK 103.4 billion from SEK 119.5 billion. The last quarter's turnover decreased to SEK 23.6 billion from 26.5 billion. Operating profit for October-December was nearly SEK half a billion, down from SEK 2.4 billion a year earlier. The company attributes this decline to a weak market and plans adjustments in the first half of the year through flexible working hours and cost constraints.",
