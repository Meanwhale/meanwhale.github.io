    "news_text": "Finland is grappling with the complexities of enforcing sanctions against Russian fertilizer companies, which continue to operate in its largest export port, Kotka. Despite the ongoing war in Ukraine and EU sanctions, Russian fertilizers are still being imported and exported due to food security exemptions. The logistics company Nurminen Logistics facilitates the import of these fertilizers, raising concerns about the potential financial benefits reaching the Kremlin. The situation is complicated by the ownership structures of companies like Fosagro, linked to Russian oligarchs, and the difficulty in tracking the actual beneficiaries of these businesses. Finnish customs officials emphasize the challenges in proving sanctions violations, while companies involved claim to operate within legal boundaries.",
