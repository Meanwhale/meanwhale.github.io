    "news_header": "The US job market showed unexpected strength, leading to a market selloff as Treasury yields rose.",
    "news_text": "On January 14, 2025, a strong jobs report revealed that the US economy added 256,000 jobs in December, exceeding estimates, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. This prompted a rise in 10-year Treasury yields to 4.75%, their highest in over a year, causing major equity indices to drop by about 2%. The increase in yields, attributed to a resilient economy and persistent inflation, has raised concerns about high equity valuations, particularly when yields exceed 4.4%. Investors are now watching for future rate movements and upcoming CPI data.",
