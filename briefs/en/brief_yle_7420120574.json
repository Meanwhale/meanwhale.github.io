    "news_text": "According to a study, harmful gases linked to heart and lung diseases decrease human life expectancy by nearly two years, resulting in approximately 40,000 deaths annually in Europe. The fatalities from gas appliances are reported to be twice as high as those from car accidents. Researcher Ju. Mar\u00eda Delgado-Saborit emphasizes that the dangers of gas appliances are underestimated. In the EU, gas-related deaths total 36,001, with 3,928 occurring in the UK. Since 1978, it has been known that nitrogen dioxide levels are significantly higher in gas cooking environments. One in three households in the EU uses gas, with the highest risks found in the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, and Hungary.",
