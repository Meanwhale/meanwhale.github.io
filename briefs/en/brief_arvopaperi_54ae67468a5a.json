    "news_text": "Sammo&#x27;s share split allows shareholders to receive four new shares for each share they own, increasing the total number of shares fivefold. Different brokers handle the calculation of the purchase price differently; while some, like OP and Nordnet, automatically adjust the purchase price, Nordea requires customers to manually update their information. This split does not affect the overall value of investments, as it does not realize profit or loss, and taxation is based on market value rather than the purchase price.",
