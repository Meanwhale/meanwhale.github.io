    "news_text": "The Kola oil tanker, owned by Dahlia International Co., is currently anchored in Laukaanu, Russia, and has three months to be moved. The transfer preparations will begin today, but Russian authorities have not informed Finnish officials about this operation. The tanker is managed by Lagomarine Limited and carries heavy fuel oil. Finland has increased its oil pollution preparedness in response to the situation, although the risk of oil pollution is considered low unless the ship is moved while fully loaded.",
