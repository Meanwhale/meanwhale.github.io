    "news_text": "US District Judge Tanya Chutkan declined to block Elon Musk&#x27;s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from laying off workers and accessing sensitive information. The case raised legitimate concerns about Musk&#x27;s unchecked authority, but the judge ruled that the states did not provide sufficient grounds for an immediate restraining order. 14 states are seeking a judicial order to prevent DOGE from accessing federal agency systems or terminating government employees.",
