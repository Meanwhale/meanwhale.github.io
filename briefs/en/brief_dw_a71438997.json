    "news_text": "Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic resigned on Tuesday following months of protests from students and citizens, which were sparked by a tragic incident at Novi Sad railway station. The protests have been fueled by allegations of corruption and a demand for accountability regarding the station's renovation. Vucevic's resignation, along with that of Novi Sad's mayor, reflects an attempt to mitigate escalating tensions. However, opposition leaders criticize the resignations as too late, and protests continue to gain support from various societal sectors. President Vucic, who has maintained a strong grip on power, faces increasing pressure as public sentiment shifts against the government. The situation remains volatile, with uncertainty about future elections and the potential for further unrest.",
