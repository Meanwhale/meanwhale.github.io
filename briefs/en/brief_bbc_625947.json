    "news_text": "GSK, the UK pharmaceutical giant, has agreed to pay up to $2.2 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits in the US related to claims that its heartburn drug Zantac caused cancer. The settlements cover approximately 93% of the cases and involve agreements with 10 law firms representing around 80,000 claimants. Additionally, GSK will pay $70 million to resolve a whistleblower complaint regarding alleged fraud related to Zantac's cancer risks. The company maintains that there is 'no consistent or reliable evidence' linking Zantac to cancer but states that the settlements will alleviate financial uncertainty. Zantac, which was first approved in 1983 and became a best-seller, was pulled from the market in 2020 due to concerns about a key ingredient potentially causing cancer when heated. Other pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Sanofi, have also settled similar cases, while Boehringer Ingelheim has not announced any major settlements. A new version of the drug, Zantac 360, which does not contain ranitidine, is still being sold.",
