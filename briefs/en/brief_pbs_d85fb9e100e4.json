    "news_text": "UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres announced plans for the UN to fund a multinational force in Haiti to combat violent gangs. Speaking in Barbados, he emphasized the need for effective action to restore democracy, as the current mission, involving around 800 Kenyan police and other international forces, lacks sufficient resources. Guterres described the situation in Haiti as &#x27;appalling&#x27;, with gangs causing severe suffering. He stressed the importance of a Haitian-led political process for elections, although the International Crisis Group cautioned against premature elections due to escalating violence. Haiti&#x27;s transitional government aims to hold elections by February 2026, but challenges persist, including funding shortages and gang control over significant areas.",
