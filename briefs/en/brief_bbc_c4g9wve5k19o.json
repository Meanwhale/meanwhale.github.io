    "news_text": "The ruling party in Georgia, Georgian Dream, is focusing its parliamentary election campaign on the message 'Choose peace not war', leveraging the context of Russia's war in Ukraine. Billboards contrasting images of war-torn Ukraine with peaceful Georgia suggest that the opposition could lead the country into conflict. The opposition, represented by pro-Western coalitions, argues that the real threat is the erosion of democracy and the loss of a chance to join the EU, especially after the EU froze Georgia's accession process due to anti-Western actions by Georgian Dream. Tensions are heightened by a controversial 'foreign influence' law that sparked protests, seen as a threat to democracy. Bidzina Ivanishvili, the party's founder, has threatened to outlaw opposition if they win. The opposition aims to attract younger voters and frame the election as a referendum on Georgia's European future. Critics of Georgian Dream point to economic challenges, including high emigration rates, while the government claims to ensure peace and economic growth. International concerns about democratic backsliding have led to actions like the UK's freezing of security dialogues with Georgia. Meanwhile, many Georgians are more concerned with local issues than geopolitics, with some expressing disillusionment with the electoral process.",
