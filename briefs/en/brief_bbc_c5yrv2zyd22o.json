    "news_text": "During his Australian solo tour, Thom Yorke of Radiohead briefly left the stage after a heckler shouted a protest about deaths in Gaza. The heckler called for Yorke to condemn what he termed the 'Israeli genocide of Gaza.' Yorke responded by inviting the heckler to come on stage and express his views directly. After the heckler continued his protest, Yorke exited the stage but returned shortly after to perform again. The incident occurred amidst ongoing violence in Gaza, which has seen significant casualties since Israel's military response to Hamas's attacks in October 2023. Yorke has previously faced pressure regarding performances in Israel but defended his stance on artistic expression.",
