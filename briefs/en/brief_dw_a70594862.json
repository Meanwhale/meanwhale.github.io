    "news_text": "On Thursday, armed gangs in Haiti opened fire on a UN helicopter in Port-au-Prince, forcing it to land safely. The helicopter, part of the UN's World Food Program, is crucial for delivering aid to areas affected by gang violence. Reports of the attack raise concerns about the increasing influence of gangs, particularly in Port-au-Prince, where many neighborhoods are controlled by armed groups. Recent violence has resulted in significant casualties and displacement, with over 700,000 people internally displaced. The Haitian government, weakened since the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021, relies on a UN-backed security mission to combat the gangs, which are heavily armed due to gun trafficking from the US.",
