    "news_text": "A De Brazza's monkey at a Hong Kong zoo has died, marking the twelfth monkey death linked to a bacterial infection that has affected the primate population over the past ten days. Initial investigations suggest the infection, caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, may have originated from contaminated soil near the enclosures. The monkeys, including critically endangered species, were found to have melioidosis, an infectious disease associated with soil contamination. Although the risk of transmission to humans is considered low, authorities have closed the mammals section of the zoo for disinfection. Animal rights group Peta has raised concerns about the implications for zoonotic diseases and called for better protection of animal habitats.",
