    "news_text": "Recent research suggests that dinosaurs may have developed much earlier than previously thought, near the equator of the supercontinent Pangea, specifically in areas that are now the Amazon rainforest and Sahara desert. Fossil analyses indicate that the world during the Triassic period was vastly different from today, lacking deserts and rainforests as we know them. Despite extensive studies, the origins of dinosaurs remain uncertain. A significant fossil discovery in Brazil, dated to about 233 million years ago, has led scientists to reconsider where dinosaurs evolved. The findings suggest that while dinosaurs may have originated in Gondwana, the harsh conditions of the Amazon and Sahara make fossil searches challenging. Recent discoveries, including a chicken-sized raptor in Wyoming, indicate that dinosaurs existed in both the southern and northern hemispheres, hinting at a possible equatorial origin for their spread.",
