    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a \u00a340bn tax rise, primarily impacting employers through increased National Insurance rates. This is expected to result in lower pay rises for workers, as businesses will likely absorb some costs through profits. The Budget's measures may also raise inflation, affecting spending power. Despite Labour's pledge not to increase taxes on working people, the rise in employer National Insurance Contributions has raised concerns. Economic forecasts suggest slow income growth and potential future tax increases due to spending pressures.",
