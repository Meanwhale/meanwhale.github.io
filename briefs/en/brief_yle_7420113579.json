    "news_text": "Scientists believe that Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, may harbor conditions suitable for life beneath its icy surface, which is thought to cover a salty ocean containing potentially twice the amount of water found on Earth. NASA's Europa Clipper mission is set to explore these possibilities, focusing on determining the thickness of the ice shell and the nature of the ocean beneath. Originally scheduled for launch on October 10, the mission was postponed due to Hurricane Milton and is now set to launch from Finland. The spacecraft will conduct detailed scans of Europa, flying as low as 25 kilometers above its surface, and aims to gather data on the moon's composition and geology. If life is found, it could suggest that the conditions for life are more common in the universe than previously believed.",
