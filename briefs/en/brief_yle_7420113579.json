    "news_text": "Scientists believe that Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, may harbor conditions suitable for life beneath its icy shell, which is thought to cover a vast saltwater ocean. NASA's Europa Clipper mission is set to investigate these possibilities, focusing on the moon's ice thickness, ocean characteristics, and geological composition. Originally scheduled for launch on October 10, the mission was delayed due to Hurricane Milton and is now set to launch from Finland. The spacecraft will conduct detailed scans of Europa, flying as low as 25 kilometers above its surface, significantly closer than previous missions. The findings could suggest that the conditions for life are more common in the universe than previously believed, potentially indicating that life could exist beyond Earth.",
