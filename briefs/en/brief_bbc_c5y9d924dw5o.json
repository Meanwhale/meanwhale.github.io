    "news_text": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, the captain of the French football team, expressed his astonishment at being linked to a rape inquiry in Sweden, labeling the reports as 'FAKE NEWS' to his followers. Swedish authorities are investigating a suspected rape incident that reportedly occurred at a hotel in Stockholm. While the prosecutor has not named anyone involved, media reports suggest Mbapp\u00e9's connection to the case. His lawyer stated that he is calm and has nothing to apologize for, condemning the media reports as defamatory. Mbapp\u00e9 also hinted at a connection between the timing of the allegations and his ongoing legal disputes with his former club, Paris Saint-Germain, over unpaid wages. The investigation is ongoing, and Swedish law allows for convictions based on a lack of consent.",
