    "news_text": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, the French football captain, expressed astonishment at being linked to a rape inquiry in Sweden, labeling the media reports as 'FAKE NEWS'. His lawyer stated that he remains calm, asserting that he has nothing to be sorry about. Swedish authorities confirmed an investigation into a suspected rape incident that occurred in Stockholm, but did not name any individuals involved. Reports suggest that the allegations are connected to an incident at a hotel where Mbapp\u00e9 stayed. His legal team has condemned the media coverage as defamatory, and they are preparing to counter with a defamation claim. Mbapp\u00e9 also hinted at a connection between the timing of the allegations and his ongoing legal disputes with his former club, Paris Saint-Germain, over unpaid wages. The investigation is being led by prosecutor Marina Chirakova, and further details are expected as the case develops.",
