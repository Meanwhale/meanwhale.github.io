    "news_text": "With exams approaching, students face the challenge of retaining what they've learned. Recent neuroscience research indicates that effective revision isn't just about studying longer but understanding individual learning processes. The brain forms memories through connections between neurons, and active recall enhances memory retention. Stress can impact learning, with moderate stress aiding memory formation while excessive stress impairs it. Healthy routines, including adequate sleep and exercise, are crucial for cognitive function. Parental support can also create a low-stress environment for better learning outcomes.",
