    "news_text": "Bitcoin, a cornerstone of a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry, has an elusive founder known as Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity remains a mystery. Recent claims by a Canadian expert, Peter Todd, were dismissed, and a press conference intended to reveal Satoshi ended in skepticism. A man named Stephen Mollah claimed to be Satoshi but failed to provide evidence. Previous candidates have included Dorian Nakamoto and Craig Wright, both of whom denied or failed to substantiate their claims. The anonymity of Satoshi is seen by some as beneficial for Bitcoin's trustworthiness, while others argue it distracts from important discussions about cryptocurrency's impact on the economy. The search for Satoshi continues.",
