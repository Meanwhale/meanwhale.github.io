    "news_text": "A Peruvian court has sentenced former President Alejandro Toledo to more than 20 years in prison after he was found guilty of accepting $35 million in bribes from the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht. The bribes were linked to a contract for a road project that significantly exceeded its original budget. Toledo, who served as president from 2001 to 2006, has denied the charges and requested to serve his sentence at home due to health issues. The court emphasized that Toledo betrayed the trust of the Peruvian people by mismanaging public finances.",
