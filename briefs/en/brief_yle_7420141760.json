    "news_text": "The Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) urges the Finnish government to initiate several significant transport projects, citing the need for improved connections in light of recent geopolitical tensions, particularly due to Russia's actions in Ukraine. EK CEO Jyri H\u00e4\u00e4h\u00e4man emphasizes the importance of these projects for both economic and military reasons, advocating for studies on major infrastructure projects like tunnels and bridges linking Finland to Sweden and other Nordic countries. While the proposals involve substantial costs, the EK believes that these projects could advance to construction phases by the 2030s, despite the challenges posed by current government debt and the need for increased defense spending.",
