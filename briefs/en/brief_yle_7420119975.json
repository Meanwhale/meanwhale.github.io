    "news_header": "Papy Nkunda is advocating for better remuneration for food delivery workers associated with Wolt, highlighting a decline in earnings and the need for collective organization among gig workers.",
    "news_text": "A new phase of organization among food delivery workers has begun, led by Papy Nkunda, who is negotiating with Wolt for increased compensation. Earnings have dropped from EUR 4-5 per delivery to EUR 3.20, raising concerns about sustainability. The PAM trade union has been established, and more drivers from platforms like Bolt are joining forces to address unfair compensation practices. Despite Wolt's claims of worker satisfaction, many drivers report inadequate earnings, especially when relying solely on platform work. The situation reflects broader issues within the gig economy, where platform fees and algorithmic changes impact workers' income stability.",
