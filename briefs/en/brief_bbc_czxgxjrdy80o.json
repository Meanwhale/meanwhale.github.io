    "news_text": "Brian Niccol, the new CEO of Starbucks, has committed to simplifying the coffee chain's complex menu and reviewing pricing strategies to attract customers and address falling sales, which dropped 7% globally and 14% in China. He acknowledged operational issues like understaffing and customer bottlenecks in stores. Niccol's approach aims to enhance the customer experience and improve service efficiency, especially during peak times. Despite previous investments, the company has struggled to reverse its traffic decline. Starbucks is also facing backlash over its corporate jet use amid green concerns and social media protests related to the Israel-Gaza conflict. The company plans to release full results soon, having suspended financial forecasts due to current business challenges.",
