    "news_text": "Starbucks' new CEO, Brian Niccol, has committed to simplifying the company's complex menu and reviewing pricing strategies to regain customers and address falling sales. Recent figures show a 7% global sales decline, with a 14% drop in China, attributed to rising living costs. Niccol acknowledged operational issues like staffing shortages and customer bottlenecks. He emphasized the need to refine mobile ordering and enhance the customer experience. Despite previous efforts to revitalize the menu under former CEO Laxman Narasimhan, challenges persist, including social media backlash related to the Israel-Gaza conflict. Starbucks' shares fell 4% as the company suspended financial forecasts amid these struggles.",
