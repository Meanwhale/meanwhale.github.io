    "news_text": "Chinese-owned TikTok announced it will shut down its services in the US on Sunday as a law banning the platform takes effect. Perplexity AI, a rising US AI company, has offered to merge with TikTok's US operations and new venture capital firms. The merger is seen as a more favorable option than a transaction. The US Supreme Court upheld the law prohibiting TikTok, citing national security concerns over data collection by the Chinese-owned platform.",
