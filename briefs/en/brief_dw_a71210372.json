    "news_text": "As Donald Trump prepares to take office, Germany and France are entering a period of political instability that may hinder EU unity. Germany is facing snap elections due to a lack of parliamentary majority, while France's political landscape is fragmented with no governing majority. Both countries are grappling with fiscal disputes, with Germany maintaining a budget deficit below 3% and France exceeding EU limits. Economic growth forecasts are bleak for both nations, with Germany expected to enter recession and France facing high national debt. The lack of cooperation between these two key EU nations could impede progress in addressing challenges posed by Trump's policies.",
