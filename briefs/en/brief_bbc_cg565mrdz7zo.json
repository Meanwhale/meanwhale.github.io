    "news_text": "Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is implementing facial recognition technology to combat scams that misuse celebrity images in advertisements. High-profile figures like Elon Musk and Martin Lewis have been victims of these fraudulent schemes, which often promote investment and cryptocurrency scams. The new system will compare flagged ad images with celebrities' profile photos to identify and remove scams. Meta has previously faced legal action over this issue and has made efforts to address it, including a reporting button for scam ads. The company acknowledges the evolving tactics of scammers and aims to enhance defenses against them. Additionally, Meta plans to use facial recognition for account recovery, allowing users to unlock their accounts through video selfies. However, the use of facial recognition raises privacy concerns, and the system will not be available in regions lacking regulatory approval.",
