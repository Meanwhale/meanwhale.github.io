The attack occurred near the Bota Pathri area, close to the Pakistan border, and was confirmed by India's army as an exchange of fire with terrorists. This incident follows a recent attack that killed seven construction workers and comes amid ongoing tensions in the region, which has been a point of conflict between India and Pakistan since 1947. The Chinar Corps army unit expressed condolences to the families of the slain soldiers. The region has seen significant violence, with claims of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism by India and a local perception of a legitimate struggle for freedom.",
