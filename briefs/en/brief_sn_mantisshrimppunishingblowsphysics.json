    "news_text": "Mantis shrimp, particularly the peacock mantis shrimp, are known for their incredibly fast and powerful punches, which can exceed 1,000 times their body weight. Their unique exoskeleton, composed of mineral-hardened chitin, absorbs high-energy waves from their strikes, preventing injury. Researchers have discovered that the layered structure of their forelimbs dissipates damaging pressure waves, suggesting that nature has engineered these biological materials for impact resistance. This discovery could inspire new materials for protective gear and aerospace applications.",
