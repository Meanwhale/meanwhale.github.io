    "news_text": "Koalas, known for their distinctive features and sedentary lifestyle, are facing population declines due to bushfires and diseases. To monitor these marsupials in their natural habitats, researchers have developed a technique that collects airborne DNA using cheesecloth filters. This method was tested across multiple sites in Queensland, successfully identifying koala DNA along with other species. The researchers aim to involve citizen scientists in this cost-effective and straightforward approach, enhancing conservation efforts. The study highlights the potential of environmental DNA (eDNA) in wildlife monitoring, despite challenges posed by uncontrolled environments. Future work will focus on creating a genetic database to maximize the effectiveness of eDNA applications.",
