    "news_text": "Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun have been awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for their discovery of microRNA, which plays a crucial role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Their research, conducted independently yet collaboratively, revealed how microRNAs interact with genes, influencing processes such as embryological development and diseases like cancer. The Nobel Committee highlighted the significance of microRNA in understanding gene regulation mechanisms. Although the discovery is foundational and primarily research-focused, it may lead to future medical applications, particularly in cancer treatment. The prize emphasizes the importance of genetic research, following previous recognitions in RNA-related discoveries.",
