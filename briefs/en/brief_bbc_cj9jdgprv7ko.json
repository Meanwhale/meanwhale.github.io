    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing to announce a Budget that includes \u00a340bn in tax increases and spending cuts, as government sources indicate the need to fill a \u00a322bn deficit left by the previous administration. During a cabinet meeting, Reeves emphasized that merely addressing the deficit would not be sufficient to maintain public services. She warned of 'difficult decisions' regarding spending, welfare, and tax in her upcoming Budget, set for October 30. Reeves has committed to a borrowing rule that mandates day-to-day spending be funded by taxes, not borrowing, which has led to discussions about potential welfare savings and tax increases. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer did not dismiss the possibility of raising National Insurance for employers. Concerns have been raised by business groups about the impact of tax rises on economic growth, particularly in the hospitality sector. The \u00a340bn figure is significantly higher than previously acknowledged, suggesting a shift in the government's approach to fiscal policy.",
