    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing to announce a Budget that includes \u00a340bn in tax increases and spending cuts to fill a \u00a322bn fiscal gap left by the previous government. During a cabinet meeting, she indicated that these measures are necessary to maintain public services without real-terms cuts. Reeves has emphasized that there will be 'difficult decisions' regarding spending, welfare, and tax. She is adhering to a borrowing rule that requires day-to-day spending to be funded by taxes rather than borrowing. The government is considering raising National Insurance contributions, particularly on employer pension contributions, despite concerns from business groups about the impact on economic growth. The Labour Party's manifesto promises not to raise taxes on 'working people' but may not apply to employer contributions. The announcement is set for October 30, with expectations of significant tax changes to address the public finance shortfall.",
