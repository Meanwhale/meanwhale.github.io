    "news_text": "On Friday, tens of thousands of Serbians, led by university students, protested outside the state television headquarters in Belgrade, demanding objective reporting. The students criticized the public broadcaster, Radio Television Serbia, for its pro-government bias and for spreading claims that they were funded by foreign secret services to undermine the government. This protest followed a recent incident where a driver injured a student by ramming into a crowd. The demonstrations are part of a larger movement sparked by a tragic roof collapse at a train station in Novi Sad last November, which resulted in 15 deaths. Protesters also observed a moment of silence for the victims and have been calling for accountability from the authorities, reflecting widespread dissatisfaction with President Aleksandar Vucic's increasingly autocratic governance.",
