    "news_text": "Three Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), including Jussi Saramo, were blocked from entering Western Sahara by Moroccan authorities. They intended to meet with NGOs, study the UN peacekeeping operation, and review the EU Court of Justice&#x27;s decision on the Morocco-EU trade agreement. Despite being allowed to board their flight, they were forcibly returned to Gran Canaria without explanation. Saramo highlighted the contradiction of allowing tourists while blocking those monitoring human rights. He noted the existence of political prisoners in the region, with the actual number potentially being higher than reported. The incident has drawn attention to the ongoing human rights situation in Western Sahara.",
