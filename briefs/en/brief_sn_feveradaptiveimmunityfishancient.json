    "news_text": "A new study reveals that Nile tilapia, when infected, seek warmer waters to induce a behavioral fever that boosts their adaptive immune response. This phenomenon suggests that the relationship between fever and adaptive immunity has deep evolutionary roots, predating the transition of ancestors from water to land. The research indicates that while fish fevers do not multiply T cells like in warm-blooded animals, they enhance T cell survival and effectiveness against infections. The findings emphasize the protective role of fever in immune responses.",
