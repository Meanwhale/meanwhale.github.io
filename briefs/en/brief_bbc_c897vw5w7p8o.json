    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has been confirmed to stay in her role for the entirety of the Parliament, despite facing criticism regarding the falling pound and increasing government borrowing costs. The pound dropped to $1.21, the lowest since November 2023, and borrowing costs have reached their highest levels since 2008. The Prime Minister expressed full confidence in Reeves, although the Conservatives criticized her performance. Concerns over the government's economic strategy have grown, particularly following her first Budget, which has been perceived as potentially harmful to economic growth. The government is also facing challenges with rising borrowing costs affecting tax and spending plans. Despite the turmoil, Reeves defended her trip to China to strengthen economic ties, claiming it would benefit the UK significantly.",
