    "news_text": "President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa addressed G20 foreign ministers, stressing the importance of multilateralism and international law in addressing global crises. His remarks come amid concerns regarding the Trump administration&#x27;s &#x27;America First&#x27; policy, which has led to a boycott by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. South Africa, the first African nation to lead the G20, aims to represent developing nations in discussions with wealthier countries. The G20, comprising 19 countries plus the African Union and European Union, represents over 80% of the global economy. Ramaphosa highlighted the threats posed by rising intolerance, conflicts, and climate change, noting the lack of consensus among major powers on how to tackle these issues. South Africa&#x27;s G20 presidency lasts until November 2025, but relations with the U.S. have soured under Trump, who has cut aid and criticized South Africa&#x27;s actions. Rubio&#x27;s absence reflects these tensions, as he accused South Africa of promoting agendas contrary to U.S. interests.",
