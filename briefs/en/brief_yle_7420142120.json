    "news_text": "Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, announced that the company intends to invest over USD 100 billion in cloud computing and artificial intelligence during the current year. Last quarter, Amazon spent over $26 billion on investments, and Jassy indicated that this year's capital investment will maintain that level. The company's profit for the remainder of the year nearly doubled to USD 20 billion compared to the same period last year, driven by strong Christmas season sales. However, analysts predict a weaker outlook for the upcoming quarter.",
