    "news_text": "France and Britain are coordinating a group of Western fighters, backed by the U.S., to manage a potential ceasefire in Ukraine and mitigate the Russian threat. The plan includes providing Ukraine with air support, including fighters and drones, while also deploying ground troops to secure key infrastructure. The proposed force may be less than 30,000 soldiers, which may not satisfy Ukraine&#x27;s President Zelensky, who desires a larger peacekeeping presence.",
