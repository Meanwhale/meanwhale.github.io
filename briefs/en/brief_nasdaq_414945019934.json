    "news_text": "Chemical companies are anticipated to report mixed results due to ongoing demand challenges in key markets like consumer durables and construction. However, the end of customer inventory de-stocking is likely to provide some relief. Companies such as DuPont, Eastman Chemical, Avient, and Albemarle are expected to outperform earnings estimates, aided by pricing strategies and cost-saving actions. The industry has faced a slowdown in demand, particularly in Europe and China, due to high inflation and economic uncertainties. Despite these challenges, the end of de-stocking and improved operational efficiencies may support better performance in the fourth quarter.",
