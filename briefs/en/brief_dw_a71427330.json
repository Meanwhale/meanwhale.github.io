    "news_text": "On Monday, tech stocks plummeted following claims from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek that its new AI model rivals those of US companies like OpenAI while costing significantly less. This development has caused concern among investors about the sustainability of the AI boom in Silicon Valley. DeepSeek's AI Assistant app recently surpassed ChatGPT in popularity on Apple's App Store. Analysts believe DeepSeek's success challenges existing assumptions about AI development and highlights China's growing competitiveness in the field. Despite export restrictions on advanced chips, DeepSeek claims to have achieved its results with lower-cost resources, though some skepticism remains regarding its cost claims and potential government support. The situation indicates a turbulent future for the AI sector as companies may seek to replicate DeepSeek's methods.",
