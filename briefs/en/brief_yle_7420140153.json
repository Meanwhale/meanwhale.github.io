    "news_text": "Before the disconnection of Estonia from the Russian power grid, a suspicious incident occurred involving an electric pole being set on fire. The National Rescue Agency has urged citizens to prepare for possible power outages, despite assurances from Elering that the transition will go smoothly. The disconnection is part of a broader strategy to enhance energy security in the Baltic states, which have invested heavily to sever ties with the Russian network. The separation operation is well-prepared, and authorities are on alert for potential sabotage.",
