    "news_text": "Estonian officials express concern over potential US troop withdrawals, fearing it would signal NATO&#x27;s weakness to Russia. The chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Marko Mihkelson, emphasizes that such a move could undermine Baltic security and NATO unity. Estonia currently hosts around 600 US soldiers, crucial for deterrence against Russia, but not the backbone of its defense. Estonia has significantly increased its defense spending and capabilities, aiming for over 4% of GDP next year. Mihkelson urges for rapid political decisions to bolster defense and collective deterrence, highlighting the importance of solidarity among Nordic and Baltic nations in the face of growing threats.",
