    "news_text": "Sainsbury's has announced it will match the prices of up to 200 Aldi products in its smaller convenience stores as part of a strategy to attract more customers. Critics have pointed out that shopping at convenience stores often results in higher prices compared to larger supermarkets, especially during the cost-of-living crisis. Research indicates that items like frozen pizzas can be significantly more expensive in convenience stores. Sainsbury's is the first major supermarket to implement this price matching initiative in convenience stores, although it has not disclosed the costs involved. While Aldi is recognized as the UK's cheapest supermarket, other major retailers are also trying to compete by matching prices on essential items. The trend towards convenience shopping is growing, but consumers are paying a premium for it, with studies showing that shopping at convenience stores can add substantial costs to grocery bills over time.",
