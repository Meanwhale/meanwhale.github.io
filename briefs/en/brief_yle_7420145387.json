    "news_text": "After nearly five months of negotiations, Austria&#x27;s largest central parties, the Conservative People&#x27;s Party (\u00d6VP), the Social Democrats (SP\u00d6), and the Liberal Neos, are optimistic about forming a coalition government without the extreme right. This follows the right-wing Freedom Party (FP\u00d6) winning 29% in the September elections. Previous attempts to form a government involving the FP\u00d6 failed, leading to renewed discussions among the central parties. If successful, this coalition would mark Austria&#x27;s first three-party government since 1949, concluding the longest government negotiations in the country since World War II.",
