    "news_text": "Voislav Torden, the commander of the Russian army in Ukraine, is charged with five war crimes in Finland, marking the first time such allegations have emerged regarding actions in Ukraine. The charges relate to a Russian-backed separatist attack in Luhansk, where Torden and his soldiers allegedly killed 22 Ukrainian soldiers and seriously wounded four. Prosecutor Jukka Rappe indicated that while the possibility of aggravated war crimes was considered, the evidence did not meet the necessary criteria. Torden was arrested in Finland in August and cannot be extradited to Ukraine due to concerns over fair trial conditions. The Helsinki District Court is set to determine the case's timeline.",
