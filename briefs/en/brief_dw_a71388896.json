    "news_text": "Sihem Bensedrine, a 74-year-old Tunisian rights activist, has been on a hunger strike since being detained in August on charges of fraud and forgery related to her work with Tunisia's Truth and Dignity Commission. Her detention has been criticized as baseless by her lawyer and human rights organizations. The human rights situation in Tunisia has deteriorated since President Kais Saied began consolidating power in 2021, leading to the imprisonment of many political opponents and activists. The Truth and Dignity Commission, which Bensedrine led, aimed to address past human rights abuses but has faced significant obstacles. Despite documenting thousands of cases, there has been little accountability for those responsible for abuses. Bensedrine's case is seen as part of a broader pattern of repression against human rights defenders in Tunisia.",
