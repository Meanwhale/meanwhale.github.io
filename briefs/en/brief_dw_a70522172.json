    "news_text": "Shagufta Rashid, a British-Kashmiri woman, migrated to the UK in 1990 with her cousin husband and five children. Trouble arose when one daughter experienced severe vision problems, leading to speculation from neighbors that it was due to their consanguineous marriage. While medical experts acknowledge the risks of genetic disorders associated with such unions, the practice is declining among British Pakistanis, particularly among those born in the UK. Modern awareness and family dynamics are influencing this change, although some religious-minded individuals still consider cousin marriages. Overall, the stigma surrounding consanguinity persists, but attitudes are shifting.",
