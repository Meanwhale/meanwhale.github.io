    "news_text": "According to an analysis by the Associated Builders and Contractors, U.S. construction input prices decreased by 0.9% in September 2024 compared to August, with nonresidential construction input prices also dropping by the same percentage. Notably, crude petroleum prices fell by 16.7%, and unprocessed energy materials decreased by 12.6%, although natural gas prices rose by 2.4%. Year-over-year, construction input prices are down 1.9%, and nonresidential prices have decreased by 2.1%. ABC Chief Economist Anirban Basu noted that the decline in construction costs was mainly due to lower oil prices, but certain materials like gypsum and lumber experienced price increases. Concerns about rising global shipping costs and supply chain disruptions may lead to higher material prices in the future, affecting contractors' profit margins.",
