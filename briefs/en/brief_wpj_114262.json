    "news_text": "According to a new analysis by the Associated Builders and Contractors, U.S. construction input prices decreased by 0.9% in September 2024, with nonresidential construction input prices experiencing the same decline. Notably, crude petroleum prices dropped by 16.7%, and unprocessed energy materials fell by 12.6%, although natural gas prices increased by 2.4%. Year-over-year, construction input prices are down 1.9%, and nonresidential prices are down 2.1%. ABC Chief Economist Anirban Basu noted that while the drop was mainly due to falling oil prices, certain materials like gypsum and lumber saw price increases. Concerns remain about rising global shipping costs and supply chain disruptions, which could affect future material prices and profit margins for contractors.",
