The unnamed man, reportedly Col Dmytro Kozyura, was chief of staff at the anti-terrorism center. The SBU claims he transmitted information to Russia on at least 14 occasions. The investigation involved extensive monitoring and the use of technology to gather evidence. The SBU has been actively working to expose Russian agents since the invasion in February 2022. The head of the SBU, Vasyl Malyuk, was directly involved in the investigation and reported to President Zelensky. The suspect was reportedly recruited by Russia&#x27;s FSB in 2018 and had been inactive until recently. Malyuk stated that the SBU had been feeding disinformation to Moscow during the investigation.",
