    "news_text": "Cubs of collective whales learn their species&#x27; typical pronunciation like human children learn language. Male humpback whales&#x27; songs, which change over time, may serve reproductive purposes. Research over eight years near New Caledonia revealed that the structure of whale songs resembles language learning in children, following patterns similar to Zipf&#x27;s law in human languages. The study suggests that both whale songs and human language are learned through cultural interaction, though it does not imply that whale songs carry complex meanings like human phrases.",
