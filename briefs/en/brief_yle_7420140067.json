    "news_text": "In an interview with Reuters, Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur proposed an additional charge for shipping companies operating in the Baltic Sea. The revenue generated from this fee would be allocated to the protection of undersea cables. Pevkur mentioned that various methods for securing these cables are currently being considered, including the installation of automatic sensor systems on the seabed and the use of barriers, both of which are expensive. He compared this proposed fee to airport fees included in ticket prices, suggesting that similar charges could be applied to shipping companies passing through the Danish straits.",
