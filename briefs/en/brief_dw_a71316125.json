    "news_text": "When the Santa Ana winds weaken, aerial firefighting becomes possible in the Greater Los Angeles area using pink fire retardants that help extinguish flames. These retardants, while effective in slowing fire spread, raise concerns about their chemical composition and potential health risks, especially for children. Studies show that exposure to smoke from wildfires can lead to severe health issues, including increased dementia risk. Additionally, some retardants may be harmful to the environment, causing pollution and accumulating in the food chain. Despite being deemed safe by manufacturers, the combination of smoke and retardants can irritate airways and skin, highlighting the need for careful management of these substances.",
