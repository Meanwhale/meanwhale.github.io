    "news_text": "Pekka Lundmark, the CEO of Nokia, is stepping down after nearly five years, with his departure framed as a personal decision for a career change. Analysts, including Ate Riikola, reflect on Lundmark&#x27;s leadership, highlighting significant advancements in 5G technology and network infrastructure during his tenure. However, they point out that Nokia&#x27;s stock performance has been lackluster, with little value created for shareholders. The new CEO, Justin Hotard, is expected to focus more on network infrastructure and capitalize on the growing demand for data centers, driven by the artificial intelligence boom.",
