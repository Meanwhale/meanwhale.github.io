    "news_text": "Samuel Shafiishuna Nujoma was a freedom fighter and leader of SWAPO, instrumental in Namibia&#x27;s struggle for independence from South Africa. Born in 1929, he faced limited educational opportunities but became politically active, founding the Ovamboland People&#x27;s Organization and later leading SWAPO in armed resistance. After decades of struggle, Namibia gained independence in 1990, and Nujoma became its first president, serving for 15 years. He was known for promoting national reconciliation but faced criticism for constitutional amendments allowing him to extend his presidency. Nujoma remained politically active even after stepping down in 2007.",
