    "news_text": "On October 26, Georgians will vote in a crucial election that poses a stark choice between aligning with Europe or Russia. The ruling Georgian Dream party, which has ties to Russia, promotes a narrative that voting for the opposition could lead to war, leveraging fears from past conflicts. The opposition, however, advocates for European integration and democratic values, with significant public support evident in protests against recent laws perceived as pro-Russian. Young activists express a desire for a future free from Russian influence, while concerns about election integrity and potential government repression loom large. The election is seen as a decisive moment for Georgia's political future, with implications for its sovereignty and relationship with the West.",
