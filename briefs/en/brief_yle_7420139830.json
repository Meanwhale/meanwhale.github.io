    "news_text": "A study by the Natural Resources Centre (Luke) found that one hectare of book nightmare has spread from protected areas in Finland, with total damage reaching 60,000 hectares. The research indicates that the spread from conservation areas does not significantly increase the risk of tree damage in surrounding economic forests. Between 2014 and 2024, seven cases of book nightmare spreading from protected areas to commercial forests were identified, resulting in approximately 160 cubic meters of wood damage, equivalent to one hectare of logging. In 2023, over 60,000 hectares were affected by book nightmares, but the damage from nature reserves is minimal. The report emphasizes the misunderstanding regarding the impact of nature conservation areas, stating that disturbances in these areas are part of normal forest dynamics.",
