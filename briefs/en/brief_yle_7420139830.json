    "news_text": "In Finland, a hectare of book nightmare has spread from protected areas, contributing to a total damage of 60,000 hectares. A study by the Natural Resources Centre (Luke) found that the spread from conservation areas does not significantly increase the risk of tree damage in adjacent economic forests. Between 2014 and 2024, seven cases were identified where the book nightmare spread from protected areas to commercial forests, resulting in approximately 160 cubic metres of wood damage, equivalent to one hectare of logging. In 2023, over 60,000 hectares were affected by book nightmares, but the damage from nature reserves is minimal. The report highlights misunderstandings regarding the impact of conservation areas on economic forests, emphasizing that natural disturbances are part of forest dynamics.",
