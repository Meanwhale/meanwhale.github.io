    "news_text": "Vodafone has successfully executed what it claims is the UK's first satellite-enabled smartphone video call from a mountain in Ceredigion, Wales. This initiative is part of Vodafone's plan to integrate satellite connectivity into its UK network by the end of the year and across Europe by 2026. The move aims to eliminate 'not spots'\u2014areas lacking mobile signal\u2014affecting about 9% of the UK. However, experts warn that regulatory challenges and the need for more satellites must be addressed for the service to succeed. While current emergency satellite connectivity is text-based, Vodafone's new service allows for video calls without additional equipment. The company is collaborating with AST SpaceMobile, which currently has limited satellites in orbit. Concerns have been raised by astronomers about the impact of increasing satellites on space observation, as they can interfere with astronomical images and make it harder to detect asteroids. Astronaut Tim Peak emphasized the need for responsible management of satellite deployment.",
