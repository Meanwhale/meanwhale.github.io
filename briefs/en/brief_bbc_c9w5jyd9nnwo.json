She was instructed to sabotage military assets but instead reported the incident to the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU). Despite receiving threats about her husband's safety, she stood firm and refused to comply. The SBU warned her that cooperating with Russian agents could worsen her husband's situation. After months of uncertainty, Dima was released, and they reunited joyfully.",
