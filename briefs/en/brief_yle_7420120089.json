    "news_text": "The International Criminal Court (ICC) is considering further actions against Gogolia after Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit in early September. Putin's trip raised concerns due to an existing ICC arrest warrant issued against him for the expropriation of Ukrainian children. However, the ICC lacks enforcement mechanisms to compel compliance from member states. It is believed that Putin pressured Gogolia into accepting his visit, as Gogolia relies heavily on Russia, particularly for energy. Last year, Putin had canceled a planned trip to a summit in South Africa.",
