    "news_text": "China has introduced taxes on imports of European brandy, a move France deems retaliatory following the EU's recent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. The European Commission intends to contest this action at the World Trade Organization (WTO), labeling it an 'abuse' of trade defense measures. In contrast, China defends the tax as an 'anti-dumping' measure aimed at protecting its domestic producers. French brandy producers, including major brands like Hennessy and Remy Martin, warn that these duties could be 'catastrophic' for the industry, leading to a significant drop in shares of brandy companies. France, which supplies 99% of brandy to China, is seeking EU support to address this issue at the WTO. Additionally, China is contemplating new tariffs on other EU imports, including cars and dairy products, in response to the EU's tariffs on its electric vehicles.",
