    "news_text": "Researchers have determined that a large fossil of Rhamphorhynchus, previously thought to be a distinct species, is actually a supersized adult of R. muensteri. This finding indicates that as Rhamphorhynchus grew, its teeth evolved from needle-like to broader shapes, possibly reflecting a change in diet from small marine prey to larger terrestrial animals. The study highlights how pterosaurs may have adapted physically and ecologically throughout their lives.",
