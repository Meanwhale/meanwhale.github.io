    "news_text": "Electricity sellers have ramped up special offers, including a six-month fixed-term contract priced at 6.99 cents per kWh, with a basic fee of EUR 5.99 monthly, according to Helen. The current electricity supply prices are affordable, especially during winter, and there are various offers available from different vendors. The average price of electricity in spring and summer was around nine cents per kWh, with long-term contracts generally being more expensive due to seasonal variations. The market is active, and while current conditions favor lower prices, there are potential risks that could affect future pricing.",
