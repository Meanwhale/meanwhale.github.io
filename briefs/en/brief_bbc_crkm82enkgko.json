    "news_text": "An expedition by RMS Titanic Inc has shown the ongoing deterioration of the Titanic wreck, with a notable section of railing now missing and on the sea floor. This railing, featured in the iconic movie scene with Jack and Rose, was discovered during underwater robot dives this summer. The ship, which sank in 1912, is being affected by microbial decay, leading to the formation of rusticles. The team also rediscovered the Diana of Versailles statue, previously lost since the sinking. RMS Titanic Inc plans to return next year to recover more artifacts, sparking debate over whether the wreck should be treated as a grave site or a historical artifact to be preserved and displayed.",
