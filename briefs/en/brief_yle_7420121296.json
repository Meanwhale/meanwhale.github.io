    "news_text": "Linkosuo, a bakery caf\u00e9 company in Tampere, has initiated change negotiations for economic and production reasons, impacting the entire Linkosuo Group. CEO Jyrki Karlsson stated that the company is not meeting desired efficiency levels and aims to improve operations. The negotiations could result in job losses, with up to ten bakeries and cafes potentially closing. Karlsson emphasized that the goal is to achieve sustainable cost levels to enable future investments. The company has faced challenges from the pandemic, the Ukrainian War, rising raw material and energy costs, and decreasing consumer purchasing power. The staff was surprised by the negotiations, as there was no prior notice.",
