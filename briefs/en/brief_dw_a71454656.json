    "news_original_title": "India-Germany submarine deal: What does it mean for Russia?",
    "news_text": "Thyssenkrupp, a German engineering conglomerate, has secured a deal to construct six submarines for the Indian navy in partnership with Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders. This $5.2 billion contract follows the approval of their bid by India's Ministry of Defense, which was the only one to pass the navy's field trials. The submarines will feature air-independent propulsion technology and are part of India's strategy to enhance its naval capabilities amid growing Chinese presence in the region. Despite this collaboration, India's reliance on Russian military imports remains significant, with Russia accounting for 36% of India's defense imports from 2019-2023. The deal aligns with Prime Minister Modi's push for domestic defense manufacturing, although India's defense spending as a percentage of GDP has decreased in recent years.",
