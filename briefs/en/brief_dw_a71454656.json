    "news_original_title": "India-Germany submarine deal: What does it mean for Russia?",
    "news_text": "Thyssenkrupp, a German engineering conglomerate, has secured a deal to construct six submarines for the Indian navy in partnership with Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders. This $5.2 billion contract follows the approval of their bid by India&#x27;s Ministry of Defense, which was the only one to pass the navy&#x27;s field trials. The submarines will feature air-independent propulsion technology and are part of India&#x27;s strategy to enhance its naval capabilities amid growing Chinese presence in the region. Despite this collaboration, India&#x27;s reliance on Russian military imports remains significant, with Russia accounting for 36% of India&#x27;s defense imports from 2019-2023. The deal aligns with Prime Minister Modi&#x27;s push for domestic defense manufacturing, although India&#x27;s defense spending as a percentage of GDP has decreased in recent years.",
