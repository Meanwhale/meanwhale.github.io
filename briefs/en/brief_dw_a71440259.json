    "news_text": "The Trump administration is introducing a 'deferred resignation program' for federal employees, allowing them to keep their pay and benefits until September 30 if they opt not to return to work in person. Employees have until February 6 to decide on participation. The administration also plans to reduce government size, anticipating a more streamlined workforce, while some agencies may increase staff. The American Federation of Government Employees criticized the proposal, suggesting it creates a toxic work environment and warns of negative consequences from removing dedicated federal employees.",
