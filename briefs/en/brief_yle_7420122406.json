    "news_text": "The Earth is shielded by a magnetic field, and if it fails, harmful space radiation could reach the surface. The University of Oulu has been awarded a \u20ac10 million grant from the European Research Council for research into space physics and anomalies. This funding will support four research teams, including those from Helsinki, Vienna, and Potsdam, and aims to understand the geomagnetic field's role in protecting the planet. The research will also explore the implications of potential magnetic field changes on technology and the environment. The project aims to educate young scientists and create a comprehensive model of the solar system, potentially influencing fields like exoplanet physics and evolutionary biology.",
