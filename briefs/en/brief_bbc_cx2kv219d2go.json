    "news_text": "Judge Robert McBurney ruled against the Georgia election board's last-minute mandate for hand-counting ballots in the November presidential election, stating that poll workers would not be sufficiently trained for the task, which could lead to administrative chaos. The ruling was welcomed by Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, as early voting began in Georgia with record turnout. The hand-count rule, passed by a pro-Trump majority, would have required poll workers to manually count millions of ballots, raising concerns about election integrity and public confidence. The judge emphasized that adding uncertainty to the electoral process is detrimental to the public. Meanwhile, Trump held a rally in Atlanta, reiterating his claims about the 2020 election being stolen, while Harris urged black voters to remain engaged in politics.",
