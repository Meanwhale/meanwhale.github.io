    "news_text": "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Thomas Cox ruled against seven new election rules in Georgia that were supported by Republican Donald Trump, stating they unlawfully interfered with the voting process. Among the blocked rules was a requirement for hand counting ballots, which critics argued would delay results. Early voting in Georgia has seen record participation, with over 459,000 votes cast on the first day. The ruling comes amid ongoing legal challenges faced by Trump regarding his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. The judge emphasized that adding uncertainty to the electoral process is detrimental to public confidence.",
