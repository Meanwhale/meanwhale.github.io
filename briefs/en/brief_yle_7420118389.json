    "news_text": "Easter Island, located in the southern Pacific Ocean, has a coastline of about 30 kilometers but accumulates 50 times more plastic waste than Chile, which has a coastline exceeding 2,000 kilometers. The South Pacific orbit sea stream brings plastic waste from South America, Australia, and fishing vessels. An international marine biologist, Moiko Pakomio, noted that 58% of the island's plastic waste originates from Chile, 3,000 kilometers away. Fishing boats contribute significantly to the pollution by discarding waste into the ocean. This plastic waste has contaminated the entire food chain, affecting both marine life and local residents. A United Nations Conference on Plastic Waste is scheduled for the end of November in South Korea.",
