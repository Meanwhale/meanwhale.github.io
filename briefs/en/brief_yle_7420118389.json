    "news_text": "Easter Island, located in the southern Pacific Ocean, has a coastline of about 30 kilometers but contains 50 times more plastic waste than Chile, which has a coastline exceeding 2,000 kilometers. The South Pacific orbit sea stream brings plastic waste from South America, Australia, and fishing vessels. According to marine expert Moiko Pakomio, 58% of the plastic waste on the island originates from Chile, located 3,000 kilometers away. Fishing boats contribute significantly to the pollution by discarding waste into the sea, which has contaminated the entire food chain, affecting both residents and animals. A United Nations Conference on Plastic Waste is scheduled for the end of November in South Korea.",
