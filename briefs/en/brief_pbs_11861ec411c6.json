    "news_text": "This comes amid ongoing conflict and a shaky ceasefire, with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio supporting Israel&#x27;s war aims. Critics argue that the plan amounts to coercion due to the destruction in Gaza. Netanyahu has indicated a willingness to resume fighting after the ceasefire, while Hamas maintains control and rejects surrendering. Arab leaders face domestic backlash over the proposal, and Egypt is working on a counterproposal for Gaza&#x27;s rebuilding without population removal.",
