    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that the government will fund tunnelling work to extend the HS2 high-speed rail project to London Euston station. This move is expected to encourage private investment in the area, which was previously reliant on such funding to save taxpayer money. Camden Council and local traders welcomed the announcement, while critics called for the project to be scrapped, citing concerns over its viability and environmental impact. Major construction work at Euston has been paused due to funding uncertainties. Local leaders hope the project will bring much-needed economic benefits to the community.",
