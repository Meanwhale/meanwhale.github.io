    "news_text": "Italy has enacted a law making it illegal for couples to seek surrogacy abroad, extending an existing ban within the country. Those who violate this law could face up to two years in prison and fines of up to \u20ac1 million. Critics, including LGBT activists, argue that the law disproportionately affects LGBT couples, who already face restrictions on adoption and IVF. The law was passed by a vote of 84 to 58 in the Senate and is part of the agenda of Italy's far-right government led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has previously expressed opposition to LGBT rights and surrogacy. Supporters of the law claim it aims to protect women and uphold traditional family values, despite concerns that it complicates the ability for couples to become parents in a country with a declining birth rate.",
