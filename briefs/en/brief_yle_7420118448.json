    "news_text": "Nokia is reportedly considering the sale of its mobile networks, with Samsung as a potential buyer, although the company officially denies any insider projects related to this. CEO Pekka Lundmark is under scrutiny due to a criminal investigation but asserts that the board is not actively seeking a new CEO. Nokia has been struggling in the mobile networks sector, particularly in North America, where it lost a major customer to Ericsson. Despite these challenges, Lundmark remains optimistic about the future of 5G technology and expects market growth to resume next year. The company is also investing in new growth markets, including defense and data centers, while announcing layoffs affecting 350 employees in Europe and 48 in Finland. Overall, while mobile network sales have declined, profitability has improved in other areas.",
