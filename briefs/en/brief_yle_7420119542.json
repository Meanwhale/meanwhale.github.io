    "news_text": "Research indicates that the ancient Mesoamerican ballgame palloll, played in Central America, did not primarily involve human sacrifices as previously believed. Assistant Professor Christophe Helmke from the University of Copenhagen states that while forced prisoners may have been killed, the best players were not sacrificed. The game, which integrated elements of Mayan and Aztec culture, was documented by Dominican priest Diego Dur\u00e1n in the late 15th century. The oldest known game field, located in Guatemala, dates back to around 1400 BCE. The game involved a ball made of raw rubber, which players maneuvered using various body parts, and was played in front of large audiences. Betting was common, and losing players could forfeit their clothing.",
