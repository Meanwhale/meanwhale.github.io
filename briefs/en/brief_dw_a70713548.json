    "news_header": "Donald Trump has become the new US president, winning key demographics and swing states, including a notable shift in the youth and minority votes.",
    "news_text": "Donald Trump has won the presidency, partly due to his ability to attract voters from the Democratic base. He secured the necessary 270 electoral votes and is likely to win the popular vote. Trump's success came from winning key swing states and increasing his support among suburban and rural voters. The Democrats, particularly Kamala Harris, struggled with the youth vote, which shifted significantly compared to previous elections. Additionally, Trump made gains among Black and Latino voters, indicating a concerning trend for the Democrats. Despite a strong push for women's votes, Harris's support among women was weaker than Biden's in the previous election.",
