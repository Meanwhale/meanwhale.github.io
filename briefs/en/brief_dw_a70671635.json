    "news_text": "On Sunday, South Korea, Japan, and the United States held a joint air drill following North Korea's test of a new intercontinental ballistic missile. The exercise showcased the ROK-US alliance's commitment to extended deterrence against North Korea's nuclear threats. The drill involved US B-1B bombers and fighter jets from South Korea and Japan, demonstrating their capability to strike targets accurately. This was the fourth use of the nuclear bomber in the region this year and the second trilateral exercise aimed at countering North Korea's military threats. The drill occurred shortly after North Korea launched its Hwasong-19 missile, which experts believe can reach the continental US, marking it as a significant escalation in tensions.",
