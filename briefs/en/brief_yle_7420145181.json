    "news_text": "A new saliva test developed by Ziwig aims to diagnose endometriosis, a prevalent gynecological disease affecting 10-15% of women. The test analyzes saliva microRNA and can provide results in about ten days. However, experts like Satu Wedenoja express skepticism about its reliability, emphasizing that endometriosis is often difficult to diagnose due to overlapping symptoms with other conditions. Currently, diagnosis typically requires invasive procedures like ultrasound or MRI. The test is targeted at women aged 18-43 and costs around \u20ac1,000, with limited availability in Finland. Despite its high reliability rate of 96.7%, further research is needed before widespread adoption.",
