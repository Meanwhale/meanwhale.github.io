    "news_text": "With less than two weeks until the US elections, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigned in key battleground states. Harris, accompanied by Liz Cheney, aimed to attract moderate Republican voters, while Trump focused on states he lost in 2020. During her events, Harris criticized Trump's mental fitness for office and warned of potential consequences for foreign policy, particularly regarding Ukraine. Cheney expressed confidence in Republicans who are concerned about Trump but hesitant to speak out. Trump dismissed Cheney's endorsements and criticized her family's military history. He also faced backlash for his comments on the federal response to Hurricane Helene and was sued by the Central Park Five for defamation over statements made during a debate. Trump's campaign dismissed the lawsuit as politically motivated.",
