    "news_text": "The Skipinnish Oak, located in the Scottish Highlands, has been awarded the title of UK Tree of the Year after a public vote in a Woodland Trust competition. Discovered during a gathering in 2009, the tree is estimated to be between 400 and 1,000 years old. The band Skipinnish, which performed at the event, helped conservationists find the tree hidden in a Sitka spruce plantation. The Darwin Oak and Bowthorpe Oak were the runners-up. Skipinnish is composing a song in honor of the oak, to be performed in Glasgow next year. The oak is now also a contender for the European Tree of the Year competition.",
