    "news_header": "The B.CS countries have mixed feelings about forming an anti-Western alliance, with some members not supporting it. Despite discussions about an alternative payment system, the dominance of the US dollar remains strong, and many countries are cautious due to US sanctions.",
    "news_text": "According to Russian correspondent Heikki Heistanen, not all B.CS countries desire an organization opposing the US, and the establishment of a common currency or international payment system seems far off. Russian President Vladimir Putin received confirmation at the recent B.CS summit that Russia is not financially isolated, with 36 countries participating. However, reports suggest that the Kremlin directed Russian media to portray Putin as a global leader amid Western panic. While some B.CS nations are discontent with the war, the idea of a unified B.CS has stalled. The countries are exploring the B.CS Clear system, but Putin denied plans to create an alternative to SWIFT, especially after the US and its allies cut off key Russian banks from it. The US dollar's role in global trade remains dominant, and secondary sanctions have deterred foreign banks from engaging with Russia. Many low-income countries are under US sanctions, leading to frustration with Western dominance in global institutions. The B.CS, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, aims to challenge this order, with new members like the UAE and Iran joining. The organization represents 45% of the world\u2019s population and 28% of the global economy, with China and Russia seeking to expand its influence while Brazil and India look for leverage in existing institutions.",
