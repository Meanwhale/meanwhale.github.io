    "news_text": "Research from the University of Leeds in collaboration with Primark revealed that cheaper clothing items, such as a \u00a315 pair of women's jeans, outperformed more expensive counterparts in durability tests. The study assessed 65 products, showing no correlation between price and durability. Primark aims to use these findings to improve customer value and has introduced a Durability Framework to ensure longevity in their clothing, regardless of price. The research team plans to continue studying factors affecting garment durability.",
