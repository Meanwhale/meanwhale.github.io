    "news_text": "Fresh Servant is hiring more employees in Sein\u00e4joki while transferring its wholesale activities there, which will allow for increased salad production in Peders\u00f6re. The company plans to move its wholesale trade to Sein\u00e4joki, which will include a vegetable packing plant and storage facilities. This change, expected to occur before summer, will create ten new jobs in Sein\u00e4joki but will also result in a reduction of ten positions in Peders\u00f6re. Fresh Servant aims for a 10% increase in production and is investing over EUR 4 million in the transition. The company currently employs 550 people, with 440 in Peders\u00f6re and 50 in Lapua, where it produces ready-made sandwiches and snacks.",
