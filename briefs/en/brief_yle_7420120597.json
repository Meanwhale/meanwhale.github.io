    "news_header": "Germany faces significant economic risks if Donald Trump wins the U.S. election, with potential trade wars and increased tariffs threatening its economy.",
    "news_text": "The potential victory of Donald Trump in the upcoming U.S. election poses serious challenges for Germany, the largest economy in Europe. Analysts suggest that Trump's administration could lead to increased tariffs on European goods, which may result in substantial economic losses for Germany, estimated between \u20ac130 billion to \u20ac180 billion over four years. Trump's previous presidency saw strained relations with Germany, and his views on NATO and trade could further exacerbate tensions. The German economy, already struggling, could face additional setbacks if Trump implements his electoral promises, impacting not only Germany but also the broader European economy.",
