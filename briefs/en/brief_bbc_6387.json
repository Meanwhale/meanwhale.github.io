    "news_text": "After more than 100 years submerged in Antarctica's icy waters, Sir Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance has been revealed in stunning 3D detail through a digital scan made from 25,000 high-resolution images. The ship sank in 1915 and was discovered in 2022, lying 3,000 meters deep in the Weddell Sea. The scan showcases the wreck's condition, including scattered crew plates, a boot possibly belonging to Shackleton\u2019s second-in-command, and a flare gun fired during the ship's loss. The documentary 'Endurance' will premiere at the London Film Festival on October 12 and in UK cinemas on October 14. The wreck is largely intact despite being crushed by ice, and the scan offers new opportunities for scientific study of the site.",
