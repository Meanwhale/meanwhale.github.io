Scientists are assessing the impact of the wildfires on the landscape, as debris flows can occur quickly after rainfall, carrying sediment and debris at high speeds. The risk is heightened in areas with steep terrain, and emergency planners are on alert for potential storms that could trigger these dangerous flows. The aftermath of past wildfires has shown the devastating effects of debris flows, prompting urgent assessments and preparations to protect communities.",
