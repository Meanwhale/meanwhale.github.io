    "news_text": "The Euclid space telescope has captured an Einstein ring, a phenomenon where light from a distant galaxy is bent due to gravitational lensing. This specific ring surrounds the NGC 6505 galaxy, located about 600 million light-years away. The concept of gravitational lensing, predicted by Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity, illustrates how massive objects like galaxies or black holes can warp space-time, affecting the path of light. Although Einstein was initially pessimistic about observing such rings, advancements in technology have allowed for their detection. The study of gravitational lenses not only enhances our understanding of the universe but also provides tools for observing distant celestial objects. Future projects aim to utilize gravitational lensing for mapping exoplanets and other cosmic features.",
