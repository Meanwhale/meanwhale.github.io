    "news_text": "The relationship between diet medicines and naion eye disease has been inconsistent, with cases reported in Finland. The European Medicines Agency's safety committee is investigating the potential link between semaglutide, found in Ozempic and similar drugs, and the rare eye condition. While two recent studies indicated a possible increased risk, two others did not find such evidence. The Chief Medical Officer noted that the investigation is ongoing, with no immediate measures being taken, and emphasized the importance of considering rare side effects when prescribing these medications.",
