    "news_text": "Israel has expelled residents from three refugee camps in the occupied West Bank, intensifying a month-long military operation. Defence Minister Israel Katz announced that the camps in Jenin, Tulkarm, and Nur Shams are now empty, with the Israeli military set to occupy them for the next year. The IDF has deployed tanks around Jenin for the first time since 2002, and the Palestinian Authority condemned the actions, calling it a dangerous escalation. The UN reported that around 40,000 Palestinians have been forcibly displaced due to the operations, which have resulted in significant casualties and damage to infrastructure. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasized the need for intensified military activity to combat terrorism, following a recent suspected terror attack in Tel Aviv. The situation remains tense as Israel continues its operations in the region.",
