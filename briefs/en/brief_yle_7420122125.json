    "news_text": "In October, Israel officially declared a treaty that has governed its relations with UNRWA since 1967. The Israeli foreign ministry announced this on Monday. The Israeli parliament passed a law that restricts UNRWA's operations in Israel and prevents collaboration with the organization. While the new legislation does not outright ban UNRWA's work, it significantly hampers its ability to function, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation. Israel claims it will expand other international organizations, but Finnish aid workers believe UNRWA cannot be replaced in the region. Since the Gaza War began, Israel has accused Hamas members of infiltrating UNRWA and has alleged the organization\u2019s involvement in last year's Hamas attack on Israel.",
