    "news_header": "Wolt faces criticism over long wait times for food parcel gigs and ongoing negotiations with workers regarding compensation.",
    "news_text": "Wolt has reported that 20,000 people are waiting to access its food delivery platform, which is three times the number of active electronic transmitters. The company is limiting access due to a shortage of transport resources. Olli Koski, Wolt's Senior Vice President, acknowledged that the number of orders is expected to rise in the colder months. Meanwhile, negotiations with PAM Couriers Finland regarding worker compensation have been lengthy and contentious, with claims of insufficient proposals from Wolt. While Wolt denies that the negotiations are stalled, PAM representatives express skepticism about the seriousness of the talks. The main issue at stake is the compensation for food deliveries, with Wolt stating that they have increased rewards, though PAM argues they are inadequate. The dissatisfaction among workers is noted, with PAM claiming at least 100 unhappy posts, while Wolt believes the majority of their workers are satisfied.",
