    "news_text": "A study by the Tony Blair Institute highlights Ukraine's status as the most mine-contaminated country since World War II, affecting food security worldwide. Farmers face dangers in clearing mines from their fields, with many sowing crops on contaminated land. A conference in Switzerland aims to address the demining of 5 million hectares of arable land. The agricultural sector, crucial to Ukraine's economy, has seen a GDP drop from 11% to 7.4% since the invasion, with landmines costing the economy $11.2 billion annually. Despite challenges, Ukraine exported 57.5 million metric tons of grains in the 2023/24 season. The ongoing war and landmine issue hinder food exports, particularly affecting African nations reliant on Ukrainian grain. The situation is exacerbated by inflation and a shortage of agricultural workers, with estimates for complete demining ranging from 10 to 30 years.",
