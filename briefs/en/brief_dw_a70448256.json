    "news_text": "A study by the Tony Blair Institute reveals that Ukraine has become the most mine-contaminated country since World War II, affecting its agricultural productivity and global food security. Farmers are struggling to clear mines from their fields, with significant areas still contaminated. The Ukraine Mine Action Conference aims to address this issue, as landmines are suppressing Ukraine's GDP by $11.2 billion annually. Despite these challenges, Ukraine exported 57.5 million metric tons of grains and oilseed in the 2023/24 season. The ongoing conflict and landmine problem hinder agricultural recovery, contributing to rising food prices and insecurity, particularly in vulnerable regions such as Africa.",
