    "news_header": "Ukraine is the most mine-contaminated country since World War II, impacting global food security and its agricultural economy.",
    "news_text": "A study by the Tony Blair Institute highlights Ukraine's severe landmine contamination, which has hindered its agricultural sector, reducing its GDP contribution from 11% to 7.4% since the Russian invasion. Farmers face life-threatening challenges in clearing mines, with ongoing efforts to address contamination affecting 5 million hectares. The Ukraine Mine Action Conference aims to facilitate demining, but the ongoing conflict and economic issues, including a significant drop in agricultural exports, threaten food security both locally and globally. The situation is particularly dire for African nations reliant on Ukrainian grain, with rising food prices and inflation exacerbating vulnerabilities. Experts predict a long road ahead for demining efforts, potentially taking decades, which will continue to impact food insecurity worldwide.",
