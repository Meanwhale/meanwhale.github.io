    "news_text": "A BBC analysis reveals that burning household waste in incinerators is now the UK's dirtiest power generation method, emitting greenhouse gases equivalent to coal. Nearly half of UK household waste, including rising plastic amounts, is incinerated, raising alarms among scientists who label it a climate disaster. The number of incinerators has surged, with councils turning to them to avoid landfill taxes. While incineration reduces harmful emissions from food waste, it exacerbates pollution from plastic. Despite calls for bans on new incinerators, including from environmental groups and the UK Climate Change Committee, new sites continue to be approved. Local authorities face long-term contracts that hinder shifts towards recycling, with stagnant recycling rates persisting. The government is currently assessing the role of incineration in its decarbonization strategy.",
