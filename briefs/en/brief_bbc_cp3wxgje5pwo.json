    "news_text": "A BBC analysis reveals that burning household waste in incinerators has become the dirtiest method of electricity generation in the UK, emitting greenhouse gases comparable to coal. Nearly half of the UK's household waste, including increasing plastic, is incinerated, raising concerns among scientists and environmentalists about its impact on climate change. The number of incinerators has surged, with councils turning to them due to high landfill taxes. Critics argue that incineration undermines recycling efforts and that the government should impose a ban on new incinerators. Despite these concerns, new incinerators continue to be approved, raising questions about the government's commitment to reducing emissions and promoting sustainable waste management.",
