    "news_text": "According to a BBC analysis, the UK has seen a significant rise in the incineration of household waste, including plastics, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions. Nearly half of the waste produced in UK homes is incinerated, and this method now generates as much greenhouse gas per unit of energy as coal, which the UK recently phased out. The Environmental Services Association disputes these findings, claiming that emissions from waste management are difficult to avoid. Despite warnings from scientists and environmental groups about the climate impact of incineration, new plants continue to be approved, including a recent \u00a3150 million site in Dorset. Critics argue that the current practices contradict the UK\u2019s climate goals, and many councils are locked into long-term contracts that hinder their ability to adopt more sustainable waste management solutions. The government is under pressure to reconsider its stance on incineration as it works towards reducing carbon emissions by 2030.",
