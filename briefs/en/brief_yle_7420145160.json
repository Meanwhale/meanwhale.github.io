    "news_text": "Raw milk, directly from cows, can contain up to six million bacteria per liter, some of which may be harmful. Consumers are advised to pasteurize the milk themselves before use. The demand for raw milk is increasing in Finland, with more grocery stores offering it. However, raw milk must be heat-treated to eliminate pathogens like listeria and salmonella. While some people report better tolerance to raw milk, it poses risks, especially for vulnerable groups. Proper storage and adherence to expiry dates are crucial for safety. The trend towards unprocessed food is contributing to the rising interest in raw milk.",
