    "news_text": "In August 2024, pending home sales in the U.S. rose by 0.6%, according to the National Association of Realtors. The Midwest, South, and West saw monthly transaction gains, while the Northeast experienced a decline. The Pending Home Sales Index increased to 70.6, although year-over-year transactions were down by 3.0%. Chief Economist Lawrence Yun noted that a decrease in mortgage rates to 6.5% contributed to a slight improvement in housing affordability, despite home prices reaching record highs. Regionally, the Northeast's index fell by 4.6%, the Midwest rose by 3.2%, the South increased by 0.1%, and the West grew by 3.2%. Yun highlighted that the New England region performed relatively better, with contract signings increasing in both affordable and expensive areas. Anticipation of interest rate cuts has further lowered long-term mortgage rates, providing savings for borrowers.",
