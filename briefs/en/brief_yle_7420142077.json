    "news_text": "Jussi Vanhanen, set to become President and CEO of the Forest Association in July 2025, compares poker to business, emphasizing that company money does not play. He has been part of the Forest Association's government since 2022 and will resign from this role upon his new appointment. With over a decade of experience, including positions at UPM and Mondi, he appreciates the Finnish work ethic shaped by his time abroad. Previously, he was CEO of Vexve, a company specializing in valves for district heating. The Forest Association, distinct from larger competitors like UPM and Stora Enso, is a cooperative owned by around 90,000 forest owners, who must own at least three hectares of forest to participate. The current Managing Director, Ilkka H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4, will serve until the end of June before transitioning to special duties until retirement.",
