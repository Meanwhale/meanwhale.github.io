    "news_header": "A recent discovery by the KM3NeT telescope revealed an ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrino that is 20 times more energetic than previously known neutrinos. This neutrino, detected in the Mediterranean Sea, has the potential to provide insights into extreme cosmic phenomena such as supermassive black holes. The KM3NeT project aims to enhance our understanding of these elusive particles, with further expansions planned to improve detection capabilities.",
