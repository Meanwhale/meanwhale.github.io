    "news_text": "Twenty-five years after the millennium bug, a new threat looms with quantum computing potentially compromising existing encryption methods. Unlike classical computers, quantum computers use qubits, allowing them to process vast amounts of information simultaneously, making them capable of breaking encryption algorithms like RSA in minutes. This poses risks to electronic payments, personal data, and national security. While quantum computers capable of such feats are still years away, attackers could harvest encrypted data now for future decryption. Researchers are developing post-quantum encryption standards, but the transition will be complex, affecting billions of devices. Upgrading infrastructure, especially in critical systems, presents significant challenges. The urgency is heightened as the timeline for quantum threats is unpredictable, unlike the millennium bug, which had a known deadline for fixes.",
