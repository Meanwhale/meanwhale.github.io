    "news_text": "In Sweden, nearly half of high school girls have tried nicotine pouches, which are marketed as a cleaner alternative to traditional snuff. The popularity of these products has surged, with one in three ninth-grade girls reporting use. Young users express awareness of the health risks, including addiction and potential cardiovascular issues, yet continue to use them, often citing difficulty sleeping. Marketing strategies that present nicotine pouches in appealing, candy-like packaging are raising concerns among health officials, who worry about their impact on youth. In Finland, the sale of nicotine pouches was legalized in April 2023, and similar trends in youth usage are observed. Regulatory changes are being considered to address the growing popularity and potential health risks associated with these products.",
