    "news_text": "China's economy showed signs of recovery in the last quarter of 2024, allowing the government to meet its growth target of 5%. However, this growth rate is one of the slowest in decades, hindered by a prolonged property crisis, high local government debt, and youth unemployment. Despite stimulus measures, experts warn of potential slowdowns in 2025, particularly in exports. The property market remains unstable with oversupply issues, and household consumption has significantly dropped. The government is attempting to boost exports and consumer spending through various programs, but deeper economic issues remain unaddressed. The outlook for foreign investment is cautious due to geopolitical uncertainties and tariff threats.",
