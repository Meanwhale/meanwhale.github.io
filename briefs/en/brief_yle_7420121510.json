    "news_text": "Innovative battery technologies are being developed that utilize less rare earth materials, addressing potential shortages. Finland is poised to produce wood-based batteries soon, with lithium, sodium, iron, and cobalt being essential components. These advancements could enable electric aircraft to fly hundreds of kilometers and electric cars to travel up to 1,000 kilometers without recharging. Researchers are working on replacing lithium-ion batteries with solid-state batteries across various applications, which are crucial for achieving climate goals. The new batteries are safer and have a lower environmental impact. Major automotive companies are investing heavily in this technology, with production expected to ramp up in the early 2030s. Additionally, Finland is exploring sodium-ion batteries, utilizing by-products from the forest industry, which could position the country as a leader in bio-based energy storage in Europe.",
