    "news_text": "In Germany&#x27;s early Bundestag elections, the Social Democrats led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz are expected to suffer significant losses, with opinion polls indicating that the Christian Democrats will secure the most votes. The AfD, a far-right party, is emerging as a notable anti-immigration option, but its unpopularity makes it difficult for any coalition to form, as no other party is willing to collaborate with them. The Greens are likely to enter the Bundestag, but it remains uncertain if other parties will surpass the 5% threshold needed for representation.",
