    "news_text": "Leo Igwe, an activist in Nigeria, is dedicated to helping individuals accused of witchcraft, a practice that can ruin lives and result in lynching. After earning his doctorate in religious studies in 2017, Igwe founded the Advocacy For Alleged Witches to address the issue directly, using compassion and science. His organization has intervened in cases like that of Jude, a man falsely accused of witchcraft, who faced violence and job loss due to stigma. Igwe's work extends beyond Nigeria to other African countries, as he seeks to challenge the cultural beliefs that fuel witch-hunting, often exacerbated by certain religious teachings. Despite facing personal risks, Igwe remains committed to advocating for the rights of those accused, emphasizing that witch-hunting is not a cultural norm but a harmful practice that must be addressed.",
