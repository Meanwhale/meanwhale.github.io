    "news_text": "Global stock markets fell sharply following US President Trump's announcement of new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, which include 25% duties on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% on Chinese goods. Trump paused the tariffs on Mexico and Canada for 30 days as negotiations continue. Economists warn that these tariffs could lead to a trade war and economic stagnation. The dollar strengthened, and oil prices rose amid fears of supply disruptions. In retaliation, Canada announced its own tariffs on US imports, while Mexico pledged to enhance border security. China plans to impose tariffs on US goods as well, escalating tensions in global trade.",
