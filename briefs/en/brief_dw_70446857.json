    "news_header": "India-administered Kashmir has elected its first local government since losing its special status in 2019, with the National Conference and Congress alliance winning the majority of seats.",
    "news_text": "Kashmir held its first local elections since 2014, following the revocation of its semi-autonomy by New Delhi in 2019. The National Conference (NC) and Congress alliance won 48 out of 90 assembly seats, while Prime Minister Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured 29 seats, primarily in Hindu-majority Jammu. Despite the elections, the new government will have limited powers due to Kashmir's status as a union territory, with significant authority retained by New Delhi's appointed lieutenant governor. The NC leader, Omar Abdullah, is expected to become the chief minister and aims to restore statehood for Jammu and Kashmir. Observers predict potential friction between the new government and the central government, as the NC-Congress alliance seeks to assert its authority while navigating the political landscape shaped by Modi's administration.",
