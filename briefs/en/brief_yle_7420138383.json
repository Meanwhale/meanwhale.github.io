    "news_text": "Traficom, the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency, aims to introduce competition in passenger train traffic by 2031, as the current contract with the State and VR ends in 2030. This shift is mandated by EU regulations, and Traficom has identified interest from various countries in operating on Finnish railways. The agency proposes a new organization for purchasing train services, emphasizing competition neutrality and the transfer of railway assets from VR to a state-owned company. The government must act swiftly to implement these changes, as current funding is insufficient and the train fleet needs renewal. Competition is expected to be launched between 2026 and 2028, with new operations starting in 2031.",
