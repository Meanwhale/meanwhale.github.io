    "news_text": "The research conducted by Ana Tri. over five months examined the impact of sleep, exercise, heart rate, and mood on brain function, revealing that these factors influence attention, thought, and memory for more than two weeks. Using brain scans and smart wearable devices, the study identified two response models in brain activity: short-term effects lasting less than a week and long-term effects extending up to fifteen days. Findings indicated that concentration recovers from poor sleep within a week, while physical activity enhances interactions between brain areas, affecting memory and cognitive flexibility. The study emphasizes the significance of individual differences in brain function and suggests that real-time monitoring could aid in early detection of neurological disorders and personalize mental health care. The results were published in PLOS Biology.",
