    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has endorsed the expansion of Heathrow Airport, advocating for a third runway to stimulate economic growth and create around 100,000 jobs. However, critics argue that this expansion could lead to increased emissions and negatively impact local communities. While the airport currently handles a record number of passengers and flights, a third runway could allow for significant growth. The project faces a lengthy planning process and potential judicial reviews, meaning construction could be years away. Meanwhile, expansions at Gatwick and Luton airports are progressing more quickly. Supporters believe that backing Heathrow's expansion could signal a positive attitude towards major infrastructure projects in the UK.",
