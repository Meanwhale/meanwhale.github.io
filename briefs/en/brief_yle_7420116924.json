    "news_text": "A recent study indicates that exercise enhances the quality of fat tissue in overweight individuals, which is beneficial for health. Conducted by Professor Jeffrey Horowitz at the University of Michigan, the research found that regular physical activity helps improve the fat storage capacity of subcutaneous fat tissue, thereby reducing the amount of fat that accumulates in the liver and heart. The study compared two groups of overweight participants, one that exercised regularly and one that did not. Results showed that exercise led to changes in protein composition, increased blood vessel formation, and decreased inflammation in fat tissue. This research highlights the importance of exercise for overweight individuals, even if it does not lead to significant weight loss.",
