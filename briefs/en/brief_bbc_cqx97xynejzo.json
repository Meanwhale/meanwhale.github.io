    "news_text": "The UK government has decided not to retaliate immediately against the US&#x27;s renewal of steel and aluminium tariffs, which will impose a 25% import tax starting March 12. Industry leaders are urging the UK to respond similarly to the EU and Canada, who plan to retaliate. Trade Minister Douglas Alexander emphasized a careful approach rather than a knee-jerk reaction, while critics argue that the UK is not engaging sufficiently with the US. The UK steel industry, which relies significantly on exports to the US, is concerned about the potential impact of these tariffs.",
