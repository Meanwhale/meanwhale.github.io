    "news_text": "The European Commission has opened an investigation into the Chinese online shopping platform Temu, suspecting it of insufficient measures to prevent the sale of illegal products. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager emphasized the need for Temu to comply with the Digital Services Act, ensuring products meet EU standards and protect consumers. Temu, classified as a 'very large online platform,' is under scrutiny for the sale of counterfeit items and aggressive marketing tactics. The platform could face fines up to six percent of its global turnover if found in breach of the act. Temu has rapidly expanded in Europe and has stated its willingness to cooperate with regulators.",
