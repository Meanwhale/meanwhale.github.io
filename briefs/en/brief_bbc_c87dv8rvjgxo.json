    "news_header": "Heathrow Airport plans a multi-billion pound investment to expand two terminals and propose a third runway to the government. CEO Thomas Woldbye aims for the new runway to be operational before the next parliament ends. The expansion, supported by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, faces opposition from environmentalists. The project includes using UK steel and improving terminal capacity. Critics argue it contradicts climate commitments. The planning process may take years, but the expansion is seen as crucial for economic growth and job creation.",
