    "news_text": "A federal judge lifted a previous freeze on the plan, ruling that the unions lacked the legal standing to challenge it. The Trump administration&#x27;s offer for federal workers to voluntarily leave their jobs with severance pay has seen over 65,000 employees accept before the freeze. Union leader Everett Kelley called the judge&#x27;s decision a setback but emphasized that the fight against the plan is not over, asserting that it is illegal to pressure employees into making quick decisions about their jobs. The plan is reportedly influenced by Elon Musk.",
