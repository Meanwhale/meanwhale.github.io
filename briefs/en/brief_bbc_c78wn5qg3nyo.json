    "news_text": "The Trump administration sent emails to federal employees, instructing them to report any diversity initiatives in their agencies or face potential consequences. This directive followed President Trump's ban on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Employees expressed fear and confusion over the implications of this order, with many feeling pressured to report their colleagues. Critics of DEI praised Trump's actions as a step towards a merit-based society, while current federal employees felt the initiative was more about intimidation than fairness. The impact on hiring and research grants, particularly in health and science fields, raised concerns about the future of diversity efforts within the government.",
