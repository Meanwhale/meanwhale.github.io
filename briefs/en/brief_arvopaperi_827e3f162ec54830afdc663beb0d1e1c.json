    "news_text": "The US labor market report revealed that non-agricultural job growth in January was lower than anticipated, with only 143,000 jobs created compared to the expected 175,000. However, the unemployment rate fell from 4.1% to 4.0%. The report also noted a revision of December's job growth from 223,000 to 273,000. Wage growth accelerated to 0.5% annually. The report is likely to influence interest rates, with the dollar strengthening slightly and government loan rates rising.",
