    "news_text": "Huda Khayti, a Syrian woman from Duma, expresses relief at the fall of Bashar Assad&#x27;s regime but faces the devastation of her hometown. Despite the destruction, she is determined to rebuild and has initiated projects to restore life in Duma. Khayti has a history of advocating for women&#x27;s rights and has established centers for education and support. Following the regime&#x27;s overthrow by the Islamist group HTS, she returned to Duma to witness the ruins of her past. With the country in dire economic straits and many dependent on aid, she remains hopeful and plans to open more women&#x27;s centers and environmental organizations. Khayti emphasizes the importance of self-reliance and opposes foreign interference in Syria&#x27;s reconstruction.",
