    "news_text": "On Thursday, Austrian parliamentarians elected Walter Rosenkranz from the far-right Freedom Party (FP\u00d6) as the new speaker, the first time a far-right politician has held this position, which is second only to the president. The FP\u00d6 secured 28.9% of the votes in the recent elections but did not achieve a majority. Rosenkranz received 100 out of 183 votes, with opposition from Green Party members and others. Jewish groups expressed concerns over his election due to his far-right affiliations. Despite their electoral success, the FP\u00d6 is unlikely to lead the government as other parties, including the conservative \u00d6VP, refuse to collaborate with them. Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen has invited \u00d6VP leader Karl Nehammer to negotiate a coalition with the Social Democratic Party (SP\u00d6), with talks set to begin soon.",
