    "news_text": "Finnish citizens are not performing well in seeking EU positions, with a notable decline in interest and success in selection tests. Juuso J\u00e4rviniemi, who secured a position in the EU Commission, reflects on the challenges faced by Finns in the recruitment process. The Finnish Permanent Representation in Brussels highlights that unfamiliarity with the application procedures and structured interviews contributes to poor performance. National competitions for EU positions are being considered to improve representation from under-represented countries like Finland. The EU is also experimenting with a large recruitment drive, but many Finns feel they are competing against all of Europe. J\u00e4rviniemi emphasizes that with good preparation, success is achievable.",
