    "news_text": "A survey of around 340 hosting professionals in Finland revealed that more than one-third of hosts believe there have been too few repairs in the housing companies they manage. Many reported that renovation projects have been completed or reduced in the past year due to economic factors. The main reasons cited for the lack of repairs include the unwillingness of shareholders and the high costs associated with the repairs. The respondents managed approximately 8,300 housing companies.",
