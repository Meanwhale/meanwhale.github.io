    "news_text": "President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had a significant 30-minute phone call, their first since August, focusing on Israel's planned retaliation against Iran following a missile strike. The White House described the conversation as 'direct' and 'productive', with both leaders agreeing to maintain close contact. Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant indicated that the planned attack on Iran would be 'deadly, precise, and surprising'. While Biden is cautious about the US getting involved in a war with Iran, some Israeli leaders, including former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, see an opportunity to strike Iran, viewing it as weakened due to the ongoing conflicts with Hezbollah and Hamas. Bennett argues that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it poses a significant threat to the Middle East. The US opposes any Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, fearing it could escalate tensions and lead to a broader conflict. The situation remains tense as Israel considers its next steps in retaliation against Iran.",
