    "news_text": "Researchers at Kyoto University are investigating the durability of the world's first wooden satellite, Lignosat, launched in Florida. The satellite will be sent to the International Space Station to assess its ability to withstand extreme temperature changes in space. Unlike traditional metal satellites, which can burn upon re-entry and release harmful particles, wooden satellites may offer a more environmentally friendly alternative. Takao Do, a professor at Kyoto University, believes wooden satellites will become common in the future. A Finnish plywood satellite has also completed its test flight but is still awaiting launch.",
