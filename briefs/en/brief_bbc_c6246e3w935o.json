    "news_text": "In the ongoing US election, Kamala Harris of the Democrat party has received 61,542,467 votes (47.2%), while Donald Trump of the Republican party has garnered 66,714,092 votes (51.2%). Investors globally are monitoring the election closely due to its potential impact on the economy, particularly in Asia. Stock indexes in Asia showed mixed results, with Japan's Nikkei 225 rising by 2.6%. The outcome of the election remains uncertain, especially in swing states where counting may take days. Trump's potential presidency could lead to increased trade tariffs and a more isolationist foreign policy, while Harris is expected to continue Biden's trade policies. The election's result will significantly influence global markets and economic policies.",
