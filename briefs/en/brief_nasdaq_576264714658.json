    "news_text": "In January, U.S. equities ended higher, with the S&amp;P 500 reaching new record highs despite mixed earnings reports. The equal-weighted S&amp;P outperformed the official index. Small-cap stocks also improved, and gold and Bitcoin saw significant gains. The Fed maintained benchmark rates, and while inflation readings were positive, concerns about tariffs and AI developments affected market sentiment. Overall, the earnings growth rate for Q4 2024 is the highest in three years, with several sectors showing year-over-year growth.",
