    "news_text": "The RSPB reports that more than 1,300 protected birds of prey, including hen harriers and golden eagles, have been killed in the UK over the past 15 years, labeling it a 'national disgrace.' Most killings are attributed to rogue gamekeepers protecting game stocks on shooting estates. Witnesses to these illegal shootings express disgust, yet prosecutions are rare, with only one person jailed out of 62 cases. The RSPB calls for stricter licensing for shooting estates to prevent further killings, while the shooting industry claims to contribute to conservation efforts. Current UK administrations have no plans for new licensing, prompting calls for public reporting of illegal activities.",
