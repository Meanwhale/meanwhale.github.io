    "news_text": "The RSPB reports that more than 1,300 protected birds of prey, including hen harriers and golden eagles, have been killed in the UK over the past 15 years, labeling the situation a 'national disgrace.' Most killings are attributed to rogue gamekeepers aiming to protect game stocks on shooting estates. Witnesses describe the illegal shootings as shocking and wrong. The RSPB believes the actual number of killings is likely much higher due to the remote locations where they occur. While the shooting industry claims to contribute positively to conservation, the RSPB calls for stricter licensing for shooting estates, similar to regulations in Scotland, to prevent further illegal killings. Despite existing penalties for wildlife crimes, there are no current plans for new licensing in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland. The RSPB urges the public to report any incidents of illegal shooting.",
