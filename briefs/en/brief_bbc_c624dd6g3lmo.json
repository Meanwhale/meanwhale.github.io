    "news_text": "Asda has confirmed that 475 roles at its head offices in Leeds and Leicestershire will be cut, and hybrid working will be reduced due to a business restructure. This decision affects less than 10% of head office staff and aims to simplify structures amid a challenging market. Starting January, office attendance will be mandatory for at least three days a week. The company reported a 2.2% decline in total revenues, prompting these changes. Asda was acquired in 2020 by the Issa brothers and TDR Capital, which now holds 67.5% ownership.",
