    "news_text": "Liz Kendall, the Work and Pensions Secretary, stated that some individuals on benefits are &#x27;taking the mickey&#x27; as the government looks to reduce welfare spending. A DWP survey revealed that while 49% of health and disability benefit claimants feel they may never work again, 44% of those with mental health conditions believe they could work if their health improves. Kendall emphasized that many on sickness or disability benefits genuinely want to work but may have lost jobs or are managing health issues. The number of young people aged 16 to 34 not working due to long-term sickness has risen significantly, prompting calls for welfare reform to encourage work among the youth. The government is concerned about the rising costs of sickness benefits, which have increased substantially since the pandemic.",
