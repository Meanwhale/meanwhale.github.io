    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is anticipated to reveal a larger-than-expected rise in the National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage during the Budget announcement, which could aid more than a million low-paid workers starting in April 2025. The National Living Wage for workers aged 21 and over increased to \u00a311.44 an hour on April 1, 2023, and further increases are expected, with recommendations suggesting a rise to \u00a312.10. The Real Living Wage, a voluntary rate, also benefits nearly half a million workers, with the London Living Wage set to rise to \u00a313.85. The government aims to narrow the wage gap for younger workers aged 18 to 20. Employers failing to pay the correct wages face fines, and the Living Wage Foundation oversees the Real Living Wage, which has provided significant additional earnings to low-paid workers since its inception.",
