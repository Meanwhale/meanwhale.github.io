    "news_text": "The Nord Stream pipelines, including Nord Stream 1 and 2, have been damaged and are under scrutiny for potential hydrogen transport from Finland to Central Europe. Finnish experts suggest that utilizing these pipelines for hydrogen could support Finland&#x27;s energy strategy and reduce Russia&#x27;s fossil fuel export capabilities. However, financial and security challenges remain, as there is currently insufficient hydrogen production in Finland and concerns about the vulnerability of underwater infrastructure. Additionally, U.S. investor Stephen Lynch is interested in acquiring the pipeline if it goes bankrupt, which could shift ownership dynamics in energy negotiations.",
