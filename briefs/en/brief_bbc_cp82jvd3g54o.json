    "news_text": "Retail crime has surged in the UK, with shoplifting incidents rising to over 20 million, costing retailers \u00a32 billion. The British Retail Consortium reports a 50% increase in violence against shop workers, with many offenders acting brazenly in front of customers. Police statistics show a 23% rise in shoplifting offences, the highest since 2003. Retailers are encouraged to report incidents, but many do not due to lack of response. The government is urged to take action, including creating a specific offence for assaulting retail workers.",
