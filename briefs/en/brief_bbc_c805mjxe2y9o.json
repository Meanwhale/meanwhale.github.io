    "news_text": "Sir Keir Starmer has announced plans to facilitate the construction of mini nuclear power stations in England and Wales, aiming to enhance the UK's energy security and economic growth. The government intends to change planning rules to allow new reactors in more locations, addressing current delays in nuclear power station development. While unions and business groups support this initiative, some environmentalists criticize the government for uncritically adopting the nuclear industry's narrative. The plans mark a significant shift in nuclear policy, with the inclusion of small modular reactors in planning rules and the removal of restrictions on reactor locations. Starmer emphasized the need to reduce dependence on foreign energy sources, particularly in light of rising energy prices influenced by geopolitical factors.",
