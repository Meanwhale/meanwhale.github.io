    "news_text": "UK inflation fell to 1.7% in September, the lowest rate in over three years, primarily due to decreased airfares and petrol prices. This figure is below the Bank of England's 2% target, potentially leading to further interest rate cuts. The September inflation rate will influence benefit increases next April, including disability benefits, but will be lower than the expected 4.1% rise in the state pension. While petrol and diesel prices dropped significantly, food and non-alcoholic drink prices saw an increase. The Treasury's chief secretary welcomed the overall slowdown in price rises but emphasized the need for further action to support working families. This inflation drop precedes the upcoming Budget, where significant tax rises and spending cuts are anticipated.",
