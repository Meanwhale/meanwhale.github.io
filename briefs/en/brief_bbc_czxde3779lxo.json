    "news_header": "UK inflation unexpectedly fell to 1.7% in September, the lowest in three-and-a-half years, driven by lower airfares and petrol prices, potentially leading to interest rate cuts.",
    "news_text": "UK inflation dropped to 1.7% in September, below the Bank of England's 2% target, primarily due to reduced airfares and fuel prices. This decline may facilitate further interest rate cuts, with expectations for a 0.25 percentage point reduction in November and possibly another in December. Despite the lower inflation rate, costs for food and non-alcoholic drinks have risen, impacting households. The government is preparing for a Budget that may involve tax increases and spending cuts totaling \u00a340 billion. September's inflation data will influence benefit adjustments in April, with potential implications for universal credit and disability benefits.",
