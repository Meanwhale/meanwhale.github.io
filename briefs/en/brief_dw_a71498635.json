    "news_original_title": "Baltic states finally turn off Russian electricity",
    "news_text": "On February 8, 2024, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia will officially disconnect from the Russian electricity grid, a move that is largely symbolic since they have not purchased Russian or Belarusian electricity since May 2022. This disconnection is part of their efforts to strengthen their energy systems and integrate into the EU's Synchronous Grid of Continental Europe. The Baltic states, which were once part of the Soviet Union, are taking this step to enhance energy security and independence, especially in light of recent geopolitical tensions with Russia. The EU has supported this transition with significant investments, and the Baltic countries are also diversifying their energy sources, including renewables, to ensure a stable electricity supply.",
