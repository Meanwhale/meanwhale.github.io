    "news_text": "In the last 24 hours, the author exchanged over 100 WhatsApp messages, highlighting the platform's encryption and global server infrastructure, which is costly yet free for users. WhatsApp, owned by Meta, generates revenue primarily from corporate clients who pay for messaging services and interactions with individual users. While the UK market is still developing, examples from India show businesses using WhatsApp for transactions. Other messaging apps have varied models: Signal relies on donations, Discord uses a freemium approach, Snap combines ads and subscriptions, and Element charges organizations for secure messaging. The overarching theme is that many messaging platforms monetize user data through targeted advertising, implying that users are often the product when they aren't paying for the service.",
