    "news_text": "In a closely contested referendum, 50.46% of Moldovan voters supported proposed constitutional changes aimed at EU membership, while 49.54% opposed them. The outcome shocked many, as a decisive victory was anticipated in the pro-EU nation. President Maia Sandu, who faced a challenging presidential election, claimed the narrow result was influenced by foreign interference, particularly from Russia, and alleged vote-buying schemes. Despite the referendum's non-binding nature, it was seen as a critical test for Moldova's future alignment with the EU versus Russia. Voter turnout exceeded 51%, with many young voters expressing a desire for a European future, contrasting with the influence of pro-Russian elements in the country.",
