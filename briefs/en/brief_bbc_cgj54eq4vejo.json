    "news_text": "Apple has decided to withdraw its Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature in the UK after the government requested access to user data. This means that UK customers will no longer have the option for end-to-end encryption, which protects their stored data. Apple has opposed creating a &#x27;backdoor&#x27; for its encryption, arguing it would compromise security. The Home Office&#x27;s request, made under the Investigatory Powers Act, has drawn criticism from privacy advocates and raised concerns about the implications for online security. Experts warn that this move could set a dangerous precedent for other countries and weaken privacy protections globally. Apple expressed disappointment over the situation and emphasized its commitment to user security, while also facing calls to balance user privacy with child safety measures.",
