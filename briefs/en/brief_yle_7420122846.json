    "news_text": "Three men, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who were convicted of planning the September 11 terrorist attacks, have avoided death sentences and are expected to receive life imprisonment instead. The judge at Guantanamo Bay's Military Tribunal confirmed that a prosecution agreement related to the attacks is still in effect, despite U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin's order to dismiss the prosecution treaty shortly after it was negotiated. The men admitted their guilt in July, and the agreement is seen as a step toward delivering justice for the nearly three thousand victims of the attacks.",
