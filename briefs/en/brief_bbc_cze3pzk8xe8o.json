    "news_text": "Environmental groups have expressed concern that the UK government's decision to freeze farm payments will hinder biodiversity initiatives. Farmers are already frustrated with changes to inheritance tax rules and the frozen payments, which they believe do not reflect the financial pressures of food production and environmental protection. The Wildlife Trusts highlight a significant funding gap for environmental land management, stating that \u00a33.1bn is needed, while the government maintains the current \u00a32.4bn budget. Critics argue that this decision will adversely affect small family farms and sustainable food production.",
