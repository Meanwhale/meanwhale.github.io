    "news_original_title": "Trump vows to leave Paris climate agreement and 'drill, baby, drill'",
    "news_text": "President Donald Trump has reiterated his intention to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, which aims to combat global warming. This follows a similar attempt in 2017 that was reversed by President Biden. The US will officially exit the pact in a year, as Trump declared a 'national energy emergency' to roll back climate regulations and increase oil and gas production. The move comes after global temperatures rose significantly in 2024. The US will join Iran, Yemen, and Libya as the only countries outside the agreement, which was signed a decade ago. Trump criticized the Paris agreement, calling it a 'ripoff,' and emphasized a new era of fossil fuel exploration. The administration plans to end Biden's climate policies and promote traditional energy sources, despite warnings from climate experts about the consequences of ignoring clean energy opportunities.",
