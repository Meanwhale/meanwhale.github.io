    "news_text": "President Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing 25% import duties on steel and aluminum, effective March 4. He is also contemplating additional tariffs on cars, medicines, and computer chips. Canada and Mexico are the largest steel importers to the U.S., with Brazil and South Korea as significant suppliers. Trump mentioned a possible exemption for Australia. While these tariffs aim to bolster U.S. steel and aluminum production and increase Treasury revenue, EU leaders have warned of potential countermeasures. Ursula von der Leyen stated that the EU is prepared for negotiations, but analysts believe Trump may not be deterred by retaliatory actions.",
