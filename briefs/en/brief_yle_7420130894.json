    "news_text": "The phenomenon of 'Firabel' work, where factory employees engaged in personal projects during work hours, was prevalent in Finland, particularly in the metal industry. This practice, which involved using company resources for personal gain, was often known to supervisors but officially prohibited. Despite its illegality, it was tolerated as it fostered community spirit and improved workplace morale. The historian Pete Pesonen studied this culture, revealing that such activities were seen as a form of craftsmanship and contributed to the quality of products made. Firabel work was not intended for sale, but it allowed workers to develop skills and create necessary items for their homes, reflecting a complex relationship between labor, creativity, and company culture.",
