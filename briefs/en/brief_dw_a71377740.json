    "news_text": "The South Korean agency leading the investigation into impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol has recommended he be charged with insurrection and abuse of power following a 51-day probe into his attempt to declare martial law on December 3. Yoon, who was arrested last week, is the first sitting president in South Korea to be detained. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials stated that Yoon conspired with military leaders to disrupt constitutional order, leading to riots. While the agency can only recommend charges, prosecutors have 11 days to decide whether to proceed. Yoon is also facing an impeachment trial, and if found guilty of insurrection, he could face severe penalties, including life imprisonment or the death penalty.",
