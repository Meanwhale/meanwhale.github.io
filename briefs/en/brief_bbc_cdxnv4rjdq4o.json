    "news_text": "Starbucks is changing its North American cafe policy to require purchases for facility use, effective January 27. This reversal comes after a six-year policy allowing non-purchasers to linger and use restrooms. The new rules aim to prioritize paying customers and enhance the cafe experience amid declining sales. The changes include a new code of conduct addressing harassment and banning smoking and outside alcohol. Starbucks plans to display the new rules in stores and empower staff to enforce them, including calling the police if necessary. The policy change is specific to North America and does not apply to UK stores.",
