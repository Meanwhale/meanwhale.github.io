    "news_text": "Mass gatherings in India, particularly religious events, often lead to overcrowding and stampedes, as seen during the 2025 Maha Kumbh festival in Prayagraj, where many died and were injured due to crowd dynamics. Experts suggest that these tragedies are not solely caused by panic but by physical forces and crowd turbulence. Factors contributing to stampedes include overcrowding, simultaneous movement towards a destination, and slow information flow within the crowd. Signs of potential stampedes include uncontrollable swaying, and it\u2019s crucial for individuals to communicate and seek exits early to prevent disasters.",
