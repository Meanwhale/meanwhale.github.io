    "news_text": "Mass gatherings in India, particularly during religious events like the Maha Kumbh, often experience severe overcrowding and stampedes, resulting in deaths and injuries. The 2025 Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj saw many casualties when a crowd overflowed a police cordon. Similar incidents have occurred globally, such as the Halloween crowd crush in South Korea and the Love Parade disaster in Germany. Experts like Anna Sieben and Dirk Helbing suggest that these tragedies are often not due to mass panic but rather physical forces and crowd dynamics, including overcrowding, simultaneous movement towards a destination, and slow information flow within the crowd. They highlight the importance of recognizing signs of potential stampedes and the need for effective communication to prevent such disasters.",
