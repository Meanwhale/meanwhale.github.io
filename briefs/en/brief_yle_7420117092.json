    "news_text": "At the Paris Motor Show, European car manufacturers unveiled new models but avoided discussing the impact of Chinese electric cars, which are dominating the market. The atmosphere was lively, yet concerns about the European automotive industry's crisis were evident, as many companies struggle with low demand for electric vehicles. Citro\u00ebn is attempting to compete by offering cheaper models, while Renault showcased vibrant new designs. Despite some manufacturers like Renault seeing stock price increases, overall electric car sales in the EU have declined due to high prices and reduced subsidies. In response to the competition, the European Parliament voted to impose tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, although many European manufacturers rely on Chinese parts. The conversation around Chinese imports remains contentious, with some advocating for a more positive perspective on their rapid advancements in electric vehicle production.",
