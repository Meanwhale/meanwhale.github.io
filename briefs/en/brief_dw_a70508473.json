    "news_text": "Ai-Da, a humanoid robot artist powered by AI, is set to make history as the first robot to have a work sold by a major auction house. The portrait of Alan Turing, titled 'AI God,' is expected to fetch up to \u00a3150,000 and will be auctioned at Sotheby's in London next month. The artwork, described as 'haunting,' was first exhibited at the United Nations in May 2024. Ai-Da, designed to resemble a human female, uses AI algorithms and has cameras in its eyes. Gallery owner Aidan Meller, who led the creation of Ai-Da, noted that Turing's concerns about AI's power in the 1950s are reflected in the artwork's muted tones. The auction will take place from October 31 to November 7.",
