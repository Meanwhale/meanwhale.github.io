    "news_header": "Texas has initiated its first prosecution against a doctor for unlawful transgender treatment of minors, following a new law prohibiting such practices.",
    "news_text": "In Texas, the first prosecution for unlawful transgender treatment of minors has been filed against a pediatrician who prescribed testosterone to at least 21 minors seeking to transition from female to male. Attorney General Ken Paxton stated that the doctor endangered the health of children. A new law passed in 2023 prohibits sex reassignment treatments for minors and mandates that medical staff should not affirm a child's gender perception if it contradicts their biological sex. Violations can lead to the loss of medical licenses and fines of $10,000 per case, totaling around EUR 194,000. Approximately half of U.S. states have enacted similar bans, but it is unclear if comparable cases have occurred elsewhere.",
