    "news_text": "A recent survey indicates a decline in internet freedoms across Southeast Asia, reflecting a shift away from democratic governance. Myanmar and China were ranked as the worst countries for online freedom, according to Freedom House's 'Freedom on the Net' report. The survey highlights government restrictions on online rights, including content blocking and privacy violations. Countries like Thailand and Vietnam are among the bottom 20, while Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia are considered 'partly free.' Only Indonesia showed improvement in its rating. The report notes a lack of commitment from Southeast Asian governments to protect online freedoms, with many prioritizing control over regulation. Legislative efforts to restrict online speech are ongoing, and social media platforms face pressure to censor content. Critics argue that the region's governments favor security over liberty, with public sentiment often supporting social harmony over free speech.",
