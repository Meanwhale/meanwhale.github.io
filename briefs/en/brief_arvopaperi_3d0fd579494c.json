    "news_text": "Stora Enso reported improved results for the fourth quarter of 2024, achieving a turnover of EUR 2,322 million, surpassing analysts&#x27; expectations. The adjusted operating result was EUR 121 million, significantly up from EUR 51 million in the previous year. The company plans to distribute a dividend of EUR 0.25 per share in two installments in 2025. Despite challenges such as high wood costs and macroeconomic uncertainties, Stora Enso&#x27;s operational efficiency measures led to a 75% increase in the adjusted operating result for the year, totaling EUR 598 million. Future investments include a new packaging board line at the Oulu plant, expected to impact operating results negatively in early 2025.",
