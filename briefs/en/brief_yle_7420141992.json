    "news_text": "Elon Musk is spearheading a clean-up operation that seeks to centralize federal power under the President, as part of a long-prepared plan. This operation involves the dismissal of career federal employees, the restructuring of agencies, and the establishment of a task force led by Musk. The Trump administration&#x27;s aggressive tactics aim to eliminate perceived opposition within the federal government, with many officials being dismissed for resisting changes. Legal scholars question the legality of these actions, and the situation raises concerns about the balance of power as Congress appears unable to defend its authority.",
