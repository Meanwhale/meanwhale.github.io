    "news_text": "Wildfires in the western United States, particularly the 2021 Dixie Fire, have been found to adversely affect the yield of major nut crops like almonds, pistachios, and walnuts due to prolonged smoke exposure. A recent study published in Nature Plants indicates that the smoke blocks sunlight, limiting the trees' ability to store energy, which leads to a significant decrease in nut harvests\u2014up to 60% in some cases. Researchers collected data from over 450 orchards and found that after years with heavy smoke, carbohydrate storage in trees was reduced, resulting in an average yield drop of 30% in the following years. This study shifts the focus from crop quality to the impact of smoke on photosynthetic capacity, raising concerns about the long-term effects of megafires on agricultural systems.",
