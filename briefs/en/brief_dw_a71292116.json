    "news_text": "Spain's real estate market is experiencing a significant boom, with property prices increasing by an average of 9% in the first nine months of 2024. This rise follows a decade of recovery after the 2008/9 financial crisis, during which prices had doubled. However, the surge in prices has raised concerns about housing affordability, particularly in cities like Madrid and Barcelona, where rents have increased significantly. In response, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has proposed a controversial 100% tax on property purchases by non-EU nationals without residency in Spain, aiming to curb speculation. Critics argue this may not effectively address the housing shortage. Foreign demand for Spanish property has grown, with nearly 20% of homes sold in 2024 being bought by foreigners. The situation has led to political unrest, and various measures are being discussed to manage the housing market.",
