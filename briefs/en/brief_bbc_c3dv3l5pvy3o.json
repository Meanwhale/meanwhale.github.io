    "news_text": "The US Department of Transportation has fined Lufthansa $4 million, the largest penalty ever issued against an airline for civil rights violations, after the airline barred Jewish passengers from a flight in May 2022. The incident occurred when some passengers allegedly failed to comply with mask mandates, leading to the blocking of over 100 Jewish passengers from their connecting flight. The DOT stated that Lufthansa discriminated by treating all passengers as part of a single group, despite many not knowing each other. Lufthansa denied discrimination but agreed to the penalty to avoid litigation, citing communication issues. The airline emphasized its commitment to diversity and tolerance and noted that most affected passengers were rebooked on other flights the same day.",
