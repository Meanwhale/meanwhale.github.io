    "news_text": "The US Department of Transportation has fined Lufthansa a record $4 million for discriminating against Jewish passengers on a May 2022 flight from New York to Budapest. The airline barred over 100 Jewish passengers from their connecting flight in Frankfurt after some allegedly failed to comply with mask rules. The DOT stated that Lufthansa treated the passengers as a single group, despite many not knowing each other. Lufthansa, while agreeing to the penalty to avoid litigation, denied discrimination and attributed the incident to miscommunication. The airline has committed to improving staff training and emphasized its dedication to diversity and acceptance. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg highlighted the importance of protecting civil rights in air travel.",
