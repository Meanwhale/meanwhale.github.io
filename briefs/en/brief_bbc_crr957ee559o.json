    "news_text": "The PKK announced it was behind an attack on Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) near Ankara, leading to five fatalities and 22 injuries. The group targeted TAI due to its role in producing arms that have harmed thousands of Kurds. The attack was described as premeditated, countering claims it aimed to disrupt potential reconciliation talks with the Turkish government. Following the incident, Turkey conducted airstrikes against PKK sites in Iraq and Syria, claiming to have killed 59 militants, although Kurdish forces reported civilian casualties. The PKK is designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the US, and the UK and has been involved in a long-standing conflict for Kurdish rights. Turkish President Erdogan condemned the attack, asserting that terrorist organizations would not succeed in their objectives.",
