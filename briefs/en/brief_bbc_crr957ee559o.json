    "news_text": "The PKK announced it was behind an attack on Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) near Ankara, which left five people dead and 22 injured. The group stated the attack was a response to the weapons produced by TAI that have killed many Kurds, asserting it was planned long before recent political discussions in Turkey. The Turkish government identified the attackers as PKK members and conducted air strikes on PKK sites in Iraq and Syria, claiming to have killed 59 'terrorists,' though Kurdish forces reported civilian casualties. The PKK, designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the US, and the UK, has been fighting for Kurdish rights since the 1980s. Turkish officials condemned the attack, and the PKK's armed wing described the attackers as 'heroes' targeting a legitimate military site.",
