    "news_text": "In Austria, the centre-right \u00d6VP and the Social Democratic SP\u00d6 are quickly moving towards forming a government after previous negotiations with other parties failed. This marks the third attempt at government formation since last year&#x27;s elections. The \u00d6VP initially negotiated with the Centre Party NEOS and the SP\u00d6, but disagreements led to a collapse. Attempts to partner with the extreme right FP\u00d6 also failed due to issues like sharing information with international intelligence. The current government formation process is the longest since World War II, and failure could lead to premature elections.",
