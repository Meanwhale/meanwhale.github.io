    "news_text": "In Brussels, President Alexander Stubb met NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and reaffirmed Finland's clear foreign policy stance despite recent disagreements, particularly regarding Israel's illegal settlements. Christian Democrats' leader Sari Essayah expressed differing views, but Stubb emphasized that only one clear line exists in Finnish foreign policy. He also addressed Finland's adherence to international law regarding settlements and commented on Minister Ville Tavio's decision not to join an equality alliance for Ukraine's sexual minorities. Stubb highlighted the importance of NATO's defense budget, stating that 2% of GDP is insufficient. Rutte noted that NATO must focus on providing military support to Ukraine, which has the right to decide its affiliations. Finland is adapting its defense to align with NATO, with plans for peace-time troops and a command center in Mikkeli.",
