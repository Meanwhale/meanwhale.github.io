    "news_text": "Rachel Reeves has announced significant infrastructure projects, including support for a third runway at Heathrow Airport, which she claims could create 100,000 jobs. While the plans have parliamentary approval, they face legal challenges and may take years to implement. Other projects include the expansion of City and Stansted Airports, reopening Doncaster Sheffield Airport, and developing a new manufacturing park with \u00a31bn investment. Reeves also aims to create 'Europe's Silicon Valley' between Oxford and Cambridge, with various transport and housing projects planned. The government is investing in green energy and water resources, and plans to redevelop Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium. Reeves emphasized the need for fair investment across all regions of the UK.",
