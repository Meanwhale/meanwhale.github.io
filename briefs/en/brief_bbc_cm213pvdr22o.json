    "news_text": "The hostages are Alexander Troufanov, Yair Horn, and Sagui Dekel-Chen. Israel warned it would resume bombing if the hostages are not released on time, following Hamas&#x27;s postponement of the releases due to alleged Israeli ceasefire violations. Since the ceasefire began on January 19, 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been released for 566 prisoners. The conflict escalated after Hamas&#x27;s attack on October 7, 2023, which resulted in significant casualties and hostage-taking. The ceasefire has faced challenges, with both sides accusing each other of violations.",
