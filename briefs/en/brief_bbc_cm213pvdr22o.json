    "news_text": "The hostages are Alexander Troufanov, Yair Horn, and Sagui Dekel-Chen. Israel warned it would resume bombing if the hostages are not released on time, following Hamas&#x27;s postponement of the releases due to alleged ceasefire violations by Israel. Since the ceasefire began on January 19, 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been released in exchange for 766 prisoners. The conflict escalated after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, resulting in significant casualties. The ceasefire has faced challenges, with both sides accusing each other of violations.",
