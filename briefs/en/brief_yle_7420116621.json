    "news_text": "According to the WWF's latest Living Planet Report, biodiversity is in a worsening state, with vertebrate populations declining by an average of 73% from 1970 to 2020. The report is based on the Living Planet Index, which analyzes nearly 35,000 populations of 5,495 vertebrate species worldwide. South America is identified as the most critically affected area, with populations shrinking by up to 95%. The report warns that habitat destruction, particularly for food production, is a major cause of this decline, alongside unsustainable species use, pollution, and climate change. WWF emphasizes the need for structural changes in food and energy production to combat biodiversity loss and climate crisis, urging immediate action from policymakers and the public.",
