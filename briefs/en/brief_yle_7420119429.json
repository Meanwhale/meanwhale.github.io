    "news_text": "India and China have announced a preliminary agreement to conduct joint patrols in a controversial border area, following a deadly clash in 2020 that resulted in the deaths of soldiers from both sides. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian stated that diplomatic and military channels have facilitated this resolution, and both countries aim to implement the proposal effectively. Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar confirmed the agreement. The border dispute, which has persisted since the 1950s, involves unmarked mountainous regions, leading to accusations of land encroachment. Following the 2020 incident, both nations agreed to withdraw troops from the disputed area. However, it remains unclear whether the agreement addresses the entire 3,500-kilometer border or just specific conflict zones.",
