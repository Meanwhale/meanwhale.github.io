    "news_text": "The owner, Grace Ocean Ltd., and manager, Synergy Marine Group, of the MV Dali have agreed to pay approximately $102 million to resolve a civil claim from the US government following the ship's crash into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore on March 26. The funds will be used for the cleanup of around 50,000 tons of debris. The incident resulted in the deaths of six construction workers and halted maritime traffic at the port for months. The US Justice Department had filed a lawsuit against the companies to recover emergency response costs, which will be dropped as part of the settlement. However, the civil suit does not cover reconstruction costs for the bridge, which Maryland is pursuing separately. The lawsuit also highlighted failures in the ship's maintenance that led to the crash.",
