    "news_text": "Bloomberg's article discusses the possibility of TikTok's US operations being sold to Elon Musk's messaging service X. Chinese authorities are considering this option if TikTok cannot avoid a ban in the US. The Chinese government holds a 'golden share' in TikTok's parent company, Bytedance, which complicates the sale. While TikTok's representative dismissed the speculation, the US Supreme Court may force a sale or ban by January 19 due to national security issues. Former President Trump, who once viewed TikTok as a security threat, now supports it as a platform for free expression.",
