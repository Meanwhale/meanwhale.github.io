    "news_text": "The US presidential inauguration is traditionally held on January 20, unless it falls on a Sunday. Donald Trump will have his second inauguration, making him the 47th president, and he will be the second president to serve non-consecutive terms. Most inaugurations occur at the US Capitol, with some held under extraordinary circumstances. This year, due to extreme cold, the ceremony will be held indoors at the Capitol Rotunda. The event includes the president-elect taking the oath, a 21-gun salute, and an inaugural address, followed by a lunch with lawmakers and a parade, mostly indoors. The inauguration is funded by a committee, with significant contributions from various corporations.",
