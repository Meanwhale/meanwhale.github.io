    "news_text": "David Goldstone, the new Value for Money chief, has led several major projects that exceeded their budgets, including the London Olympics and HS2. He will now oversee the government's Office for Value for Money, advising Chancellor Rachel Reeves on reducing waste and inefficiency. While Downing Street defends his appointment as a seasoned public sector leader, critics like Nigel Farage question his suitability due to his past involvement with HS2, which has seen costs balloon from an initial \u00a338bn to potentially over \u00a376bn. Goldstone's role will involve a team of 20 civil servants, and his salary is approximately \u00a350,000 for part-time work, raising concerns about the value of such expenditures.",
