Now, it is accused of being a hub for scams, money laundering, and human trafficking. Founded by She Zhijiang, who is currently imprisoned in Bangkok, the city is marketed as a luxurious destination for Chinese tourists. Despite promotional efforts by Yatai, the company behind Shwe Kokko, locals report that scams continue to thrive. The region's lawlessness and ongoing conflict complicate the situation, with the potential for further crackdowns from Thai and Chinese authorities threatening the city's future.",
