    "news_text": "In Goma, DR Congo, power and running water have been restored in most areas after a rebel coalition, including the M23 militia, took control of the city following intense fighting that resulted in 900 deaths. Despite the restoration of utilities, the humanitarian crisis persists, with hospitals overwhelmed and a need for medical supplies. A unilateral ceasefire has been declared, but skepticism remains regarding its effectiveness. The M23 has captured additional territory, raising concerns of further conflict, while the UN reports millions displaced in the region. The situation remains precarious as residents fear further violence.",
