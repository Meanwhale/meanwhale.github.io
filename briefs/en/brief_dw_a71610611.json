    "news_header": "A study suggests that online satire targeting Taylor Swift may have contributed to her being booed at the Super Bowl. While her boyfriend&#x27;s involvement in the game and her political affiliations could explain the negative reactions, the research indicates that satire can harm reputations more than direct criticism by dehumanizing individuals.",
    "news_original_title": "Could satire lead to Swift reputational damage?",
    "news_text": "The study found that satire often leads to greater dehumanization, which negatively impacts public perception. Although satire can be a tool for political critique, it can also become a form of bullying, especially when it mocks individuals without meaningful insight. The researchers propose that empathy could counteract the dehumanizing effects of satire.",
