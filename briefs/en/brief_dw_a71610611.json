    "news_header": "A study suggests that online satire targeting Taylor Swift may have contributed to her being booed at the Super Bowl. Despite her popularity and fans&#x27; willingness to pay for her concerts, she faced negative reactions when appearing on screen, possibly due to her boyfriend&#x27;s involvement in the game and her political affiliations.",
    "news_original_title": "No laughing matter \u2014 how satire can wreck reputations",
    "news_text": "The research indicates that satire can harm reputations more than direct criticism by dehumanizing targets, leading to a more negative public perception. While satire can serve as a tool for political critique, it can also become a form of bullying, impacting mental health. The study highlights the need for empathy to counteract dehumanization.",
