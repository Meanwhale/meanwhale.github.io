    "news_text": "Protesters in Kinshasa, DRC, are burning portraits of Rwandan President Paul Kagame and tearing Rwandan flags, accusing him of supporting M23 rebels who have taken control of Goma. UN experts claim the Rwandan army is backing M23 operations. Goma, a vital city near the Rwandan border, has seen increased violence, with reports of Rwandan troops present. Kagame denies involvement, but evidence suggests otherwise. The conflict is rooted in historical tensions following the Rwandan genocide, with M23 claiming to protect Tutsi interests. The situation remains dire as fighting continues and humanitarian needs grow.",
