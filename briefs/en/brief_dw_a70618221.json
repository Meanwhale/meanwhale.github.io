    "news_text": "Russia has strengthened its influence in the Central African Republic (CAR) through a 2018 defense agreement that allowed the Wagner Group to play a significant role in the country's military and security sectors. Dmitri Sytyi, a marketing expert and head of the Russian cultural center in Bangui, is a central figure in this presence, promoting Russian culture while also being suspected of having ties to the Wagner Group. The Russian paramilitary organization is involved in various operations across Africa and has been accused of human rights violations. Sytyi claims to be a cultural ambassador but admits to conducting disarmament missions for the CAR government. The planned Russian military base in Berengo is part of Russia's broader strategy to expand its influence in Africa, with the CAR serving as a pilot project for this policy.",
