    "news_text": "A canal in a suburb of Buenos Aires, Argentina, turned bright red, alarming local residents. The water's intense color is believed to be caused by the dumping of textile dye or chemical waste from nearby industries. The Environment Ministry has collected water samples to investigate the cause. By late afternoon, the color had faded somewhat. Residents have reported that local companies often dispose of toxic waste in the canal, which runs through an area with leather processing and textile factories. Some residents have noted that the water has changed colors multiple times in the past.",
