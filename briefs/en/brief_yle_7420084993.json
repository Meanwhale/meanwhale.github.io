    "news_header": "Genetic information can enhance medication effectiveness and reduce adverse effects, with ongoing research into personalized treatments.",
    "news_text": "Research indicates that genetic inheritance can guide the selection of appropriate medications, as many patients do not benefit from prescribed drugs. Factors such as age, gender, disease, and nutrition influence drug effectiveness, and unsuitable medications can lead to unnecessary side effects. A significant number of clinic visits are due to adverse drug effects. The University of Helsinki is developing a virtual twin model to simulate how different cholesterol medications affect patients, aiming to improve treatment outcomes. Genetic testing has advanced, allowing for better medication dosing and the potential for a pharmacogenic passport for personalized medical care.",
