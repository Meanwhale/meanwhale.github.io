    "news_text": "Conservationists report that bumblebees are starting nests in winter because of climate change, with active workers spotted in Aberdeen during mild weather. Buglife warns that nests are at high risk of failure due to a lack of flowers and potential cold weather. This trend follows a previous survey showing bumblebees and honeybees active during the holiday season. The milder conditions have also led to increased tick activity, raising concerns about tick-borne diseases.",
