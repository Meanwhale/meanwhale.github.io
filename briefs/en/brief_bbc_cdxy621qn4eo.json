    "news_text": "On Tuesday, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the village of Teffahta, southern Lebanon, resulted in the deaths of at least 19 individuals, including six women and five children. The victims included former school principal Ahmed Ezzedine and three generations of his family. The strike occurred shortly after a funeral for a family member killed in a previous airstrike. Local officials disputed claims that the strike targeted a wake, asserting that only the residents were present. The Israeli military has not commented on this incident but has conducted extensive airstrikes in Lebanon targeting Hezbollah. The ongoing conflict has resulted in over 2,500 deaths in Lebanon since October 2023, with significant casualties reported among civilians.",
