    "news_text": "In the last month, more than 2,000 new compensation claims have been submitted by individuals who believe they are victims of the Post Office scandal. Post Office minister Gareth Thomas noted that these claims followed outreach to former sub-postmasters who had not yet applied for compensation. Many of the original claimants are still awaiting payments, including 92-year-old Betty Brown, who expressed frustration over the slow process. Thomas assured that efforts are being made to expedite compensation and reduce legal complexities. Claimants now have the option to receive a fixed sum of \u00a375,000 to avoid lengthy assessments.",
