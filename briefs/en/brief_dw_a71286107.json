    "news_text": "Representatives from Tehran and the E3 (UK, France, Germany) will meet in Geneva for talks on Iran's nuclear program. This follows President Macron's statement that Iran's nuclear activities pose a major security challenge for the EU. The 2015 nuclear deal has largely collapsed since the US withdrew in 2018, and Iran is reportedly nearing weapons-grade uranium enrichment. The E3 has expressed extreme concern over Iran's actions and urged a reversal of its nuclear escalation. The talks aim to find a diplomatic solution, with sanctions potentially being reimposed if no progress is made.",
