    "news_text": "An Israeli airstrike targeted a guesthouse in Hasbaya, southeastern Lebanon, known to house journalists, resulting in the deaths of three reporters from Al-Manar TV and Al Mayadeen TV. The attack, described by Lebanon's information minister as a 'war crime,' occurred without prior warning, despite the presence of clearly marked press vehicles. Witnesses reported that the building was obliterated and that the strike was intentional, aimed at terrorizing journalists covering the conflict. This incident is part of a broader escalation in hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, with significant casualties reported in Lebanon since the conflict intensified. The attack has drawn international condemnation and raised concerns about the safety of journalists in conflict zones.",
