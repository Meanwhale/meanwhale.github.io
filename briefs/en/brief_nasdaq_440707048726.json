    "news_text": "Crude oil prices continued to decline on Thursday, dropping $0.42 to $70.61 a barrel, following a significant drop the previous day. This decline is attributed to President Trump&#x27;s commitment to boost U.S. oil production and a stronger U.S. dollar. Additionally, a report indicated a sharp increase in U.S. crude oil inventories, which rose by 8.7 million barrels last week, exceeding economists&#x27; expectations.",
