    "news_text": "The UK government has backed the expansion of Heathrow Airport, citing the potential creation of 100,000 jobs. This decision, along with possible expansions at Gatwick and Luton airports, is expected to face strong opposition due to climate change concerns. Chancellor Rachel Reeves emphasized the necessity of a third runway, despite the environmental implications, which include demolishing homes and rerouting infrastructure. Heathrow currently serves over 80 million passengers annually, and the expansion could increase capacity significantly. Critics argue that the expansion may not align with the UK's climate commitments, and the planning process could take years, facing judicial reviews and local opposition. The government must ensure that any expansion meets net-zero targets by 2050.",
