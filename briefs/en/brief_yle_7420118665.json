    "news_text": "Valio is initiating change negotiations that will impact approximately 350 employees at its Vantaa plant and Pit\u00e4j\u00e4nm\u00e4ki warehouse, as the company plans to move operations to its Joensuu factory and Riihim\u00e4ki or Tuusula. The Joensuu factory, which produces a third of all Valio cheese, is strategically located in a milk production area and currently receives milk from 800 dairy farms. The Vantaa plant produces various cheese products and meat substitutes, while the Pit\u00e4j\u00e4nm\u00e4ki area is being transitioned to a residential zone, limiting industrial operations. The changes aim to create new jobs in Joensuu and will also involve negotiations for 128 employees there. The improvements at the Joensuu plant are set to begin next year, with the Pit\u00e4j\u00e4nm\u00e4ki warehouse operations expected to cease by the end of 2027.",
