    "news_text": "Lidl is aiming to attract new customers to plant-based proteins by enhancing product placement and reducing prices. According to Laura Kvissberg, Lidl's sustainability manager, the company has removed dedicated vegetarian shelves in six stores in Finland, placing plant-based products next to their meat counterparts. This strategy allows new customer groups to discover plant-based options, such as choosing falafel balls over meatballs. Lidl's goal is to double the sales of vegetarian products, and they have lowered prices for their own Vemondo brand to stimulate demand. The price reductions have led to a reported 30% increase in sales of plant-based products. Additionally, Lidl's meat-like plant proteins are priced competitively with similar meat products.",
