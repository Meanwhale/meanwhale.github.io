    "news_text": "Researchers have discovered over 600 engraved stones on Bornholm, Denmark, which depict sun and crop motifs. These stones were likely buried as part of a ritual to coax the sun back after a volcanic eruption that occurred around 2910 B.C., which caused global cooling and affected harvests. The burial of these stones may be linked to significant environmental changes and social upheaval during the decline of the Funnel Beaker culture.",
