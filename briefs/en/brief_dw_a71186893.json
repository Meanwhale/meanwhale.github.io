    "news_header": "Russia's Gazprom has ceased gas transit through Ukraine to Europe after Ukraine refused to renew the transit agreement, marking a significant shift in European energy dynamics.",
    "news_text": "Despite nearly three years of war, gas transit from Russia through Ukraine continued until January 1, when Gazprom announced the cessation of flow after Ukraine declined to renew the transit agreement. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy described this as a major defeat for Moscow and called for increased US gas supplies to Europe. The end of the agreement raises concerns for landlocked EU countries still reliant on Russian gas. The EU has reduced its dependency on Russian gas but faces challenges with high energy prices affecting consumers and industries. Hungary and Slovakia express anxiety over gas supplies, with Hungary exploring unconventional methods to maintain gas flow, while Slovakia threatens to halt electricity supplies to Ukraine if no agreement is reached.",
