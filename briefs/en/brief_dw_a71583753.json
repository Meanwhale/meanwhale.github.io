    "news_header": "Bangladesh has been providing food and shelter to Rohingya Muslims fleeing violence in Myanmar&#x27;s Rakhine state since 2017. The situation worsened after a military coup in Myanmar in 2021, leading to increased fighting and recruitment of Rohingya by both the military and the Arakan Army (AA). Many Rohingya have suffered violence, including abduction and sexual assault, and face dire conditions in Myanmar. Efforts for repatriation have failed due to insecurity, and experts warn against a return without guarantees of safety and rights.",
