    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that Heathrow's third runway could be built and operational within a decade, aiming for flights to start by 2035. She dismissed the possibility of London Mayor Sadiq Khan halting the expansion. While the Conservatives support the runway in principle, they acknowledge potential delays. The project faces significant opposition from environmental groups and local residents. The government is also promoting sustainable aviation fuel, although its current supply is limited. Other infrastructure projects, including expansions at Luton and Gatwick airports, are also being supported to boost economic growth.",
