    "news_text": "The UK government is proposing new laws to combat pollution by water companies, allowing regulators to impose harsher penalties, including prison sentences of up to two years for executives who obstruct investigations. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized that these measures aim to end the irresponsible behavior of water companies. However, some campaigners criticize the legislation as insufficient, arguing that it does not address the systemic issues within the industry. The proposed Water (Special Measures) Bill will also enable regulators to stop bonuses for executives who fail to meet environmental standards. Critics, including the Liberal Democrats and campaigners, argue that a complete overhaul of the water industry is necessary to effectively tackle the ongoing sewage crisis. The legislation is seen as a response to public outcry over water companies' practices, including the discharge of raw sewage into waterways.",
