    "news_original_title": "Swedish woman convicted of genocide for IS crimes against Yazidis",
    "news_text": "Lina Ishaq, a 52-year-old Swedish woman, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for committing genocide and war crimes against the Yazidi people while she was a member of the Islamic State (IS) in Syria. She was found guilty of enslaving three Yazidi women and six children between 2014 and 2016. This case marks the first prosecution of IS crimes against the Yazidis in Sweden. Ishaq, who moved to Syria with her family in 2013, is already serving sentences for taking her children to the conflict zone. The Yazidis, an ancient religious minority, faced a genocidal campaign from IS in 2014, resulting in thousands of deaths and displacements. Ishaq&#x27;s prosecution is seen as a step towards building trust between the Yazidi community and Swedish authorities.",
