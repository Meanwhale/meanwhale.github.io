    "news_text": "Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO, earned $79.1 million in the last fiscal year, a 63% increase from the previous year, despite requesting a reduction in his pay due to cybersecurity problems that led to a $5 million decrease. Microsoft has laid off thousands of employees, including in its gaming division, yet reported a 16% revenue growth. Nadella acknowledged the company's strong performance but sought to lower his cash incentive due to personal accountability for cyber attacks, including a significant breach in July 2023. His cash pay was reduced to $5.2 million, making up less than 7% of his total compensation, which largely consisted of stock options. Critics argue that such high compensation is excessive, suggesting that the rewards of Microsoft's success should be distributed more evenly among workers and society. In comparison, other tech CEOs like Tim Cook and Jensen Huang earned significantly less, while Elon Musk's potential earnings far exceed them.",
