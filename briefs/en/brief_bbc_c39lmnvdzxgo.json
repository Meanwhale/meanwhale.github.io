    "news_text": "The Aslef union has announced strikes for London Underground train drivers and other staff next month due to a pay dispute, with actions planned for November 1, 7, and 12. The RMT union also plans strikes during the same period, rejecting a pay offer they deemed inadequate. Aslef is seeking a better pay agreement, arguing that the current offer leaves drivers with lower salaries compared to other TfL services. Transport for London expressed disappointment over the strikes but remains engaged in negotiations. Commuters may face significant disruptions during the strike days.",
