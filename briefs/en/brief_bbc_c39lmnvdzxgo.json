    "news_text": "The Aslef union has announced strikes for London Underground train drivers and other staff due to a pay dispute, with actions planned for November 1, 7, and 12. The RMT union also plans strikes between November 1 and 8 after rejecting a pay offer. Aslef seeks a better pay agreement than the 3.8% increase currently offered, which they argue is insufficient compared to other TfL services. Both unions express disappointment with management's negotiation efforts. Transport for London (TfL) has made a revised offer of a 4.6% increase but urges unions to continue discussions. Commuters may face significant service disruptions during the strike days.",
