    "news_text": "Teemu Hallamaa discusses the EU&#x27;s recent announcement to invest in open source AI models via the OpenEuroLLM project, which involves 20 technology companies and expert groups. This initiative is seen as a response to the dominance of American and Chinese AI models, allowing European companies to develop their own models freely. The project emphasizes the importance of open source in AI development, contrasting with the closed models from companies like OpenAI and Google. Finland plays a significant role in this initiative, leveraging its strong tradition in open source technology.",
