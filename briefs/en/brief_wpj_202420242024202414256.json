    "news_text": "A Redfin report reveals that the housing turnover rate in the U.S. has reached its lowest point in 30 years, with only 25 out of every 1,000 homes sold in the first eight months of 2024. This marks a significant decline from previous years, with 37.5% fewer homes sold compared to 2021 and 31% fewer than in 2019. Contributing factors include stagnant listings, low demand for homes needing repairs, and homeowners being locked into low mortgage rates. Suburban and rural homes are selling slightly more frequently than urban homes, while cities in the Sun Belt and near New York have higher turnover rates. California has the lowest turnover rates, influenced by tax laws that encourage homeowners to remain in their properties. Austin experienced the most significant decline in turnover from 2019, dropping nearly 49%.",
