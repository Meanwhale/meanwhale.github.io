    "news_text": "Shigeru Ishiba, Japan's newly sworn-in Prime Minister, has pledged to continue leading despite his party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), suffering its worst electoral defeat in over a decade, losing its parliamentary majority. Ishiba acknowledged the 'severe judgement' from voters and promised reforms in response to public criticism, particularly regarding political funding. The LDP and its coalition partner Komeito now hold 215 seats, below the 233 needed for a majority. This marks the first time since 2009 that the LDP has lost its majority, following years of scandals and low approval ratings. While Ishiba aims to revitalize rural Japan and address inflation, the political future remains uncertain, with the possibility of opposition parties uniting being unlikely. The LDP's recent troubles include scandals related to the Unification Church and allegations of slush funds among lawmakers.",
