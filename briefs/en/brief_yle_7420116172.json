    "news_text": "The Taliban, currently ruling Afghanistan, has unsuccessfully sought international recognition. Despite the country's dire security and economic conditions, around 7,000 tourists visited Afghanistan last year, primarily crisis tourists and small Asian groups. The Taliban faces significant challenges, including sanctions and a lack of aid after taking power in August 2021. Women in Afghanistan are subjected to strict restrictions, including the requirement to cover their faces and travel with escorts. The Taliban has also destroyed invaluable cultural heritage, including the famous Buddha statues. Recently, Russia has moved to strengthen ties with the Taliban, removing it from its list of terrorist organizations, while China maintains a presence in Kabul and provides economic and humanitarian aid.",
