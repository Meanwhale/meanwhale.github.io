    "news_text": "Relations between the US and Germany were strained during Trump's presidency but aimed for a reset under Biden. Key issues included the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, military spending, and the US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. Germany's new Chancellor Olaf Scholz has emphasized the importance of bilateral relations and responded to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with increased military spending. Both countries support Ukraine and have similar views on the Gaza conflict. Economic ties remain strong, with the US as Germany's largest trading partner. A recent survey shows a positive perception of the relationship among citizens. However, tensions exist regarding China's influence and US military presence in Germany. Future relations may depend on the outcomes of upcoming US elections, with potential shifts in support for Ukraine and trans-Atlantic cooperation.",
