    "news_header": "A former Indian intelligence officer has been charged in the US for allegedly orchestrating a plot to assassinate a pro-Khalistan activist, implicating the Indian government in the incident.",
    "news_text": "The US has charged Vikash Yadav, a former Indian intelligence officer, with murder-for-hire and money laundering for allegedly directing a failed assassination attempt on Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a US-Canadian citizen advocating for Khalistan. This indictment marks the first time the Indian government has been directly implicated in an assassination plot against a dissident. The Indian government has stated its cooperation with the US investigation but has not responded to the specific charges against Yadav. The case has escalated tensions between India and Canada, particularly following allegations of Indian agents' involvement in the killing of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada. The US State Department expressed satisfaction with India's cooperation in the investigation, while diplomatic relations between India and Canada continue to deteriorate amidst mutual accusations.",
