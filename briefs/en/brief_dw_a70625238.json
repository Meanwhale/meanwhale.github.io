    "news_header": "Ukraine faces a harsh winter with increased power demands and ongoing Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure.",
    "news_text": "As winter approaches, Ukraine is bracing for severe cold and heightened electricity demand, which is expected to increase by 20-25%. Russian attacks have severely damaged the country's energy infrastructure, leading to daily power outages of 8-12 hours, potentially rising to 18 hours. The EU has pledged support to restore 4-5 GW of energy capacity and has allocated \u20ac160 million to aid Ukraine's energy security. The destruction has led to significant displacement, with nearly 6.8 million Ukrainians fleeing the country. The EU's strategy focuses on repairing, connecting, and stabilizing Ukraine's energy system, while concerns about the sustainability of these efforts amid ongoing attacks remain.",
