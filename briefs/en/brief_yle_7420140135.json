    "news_text": "The smart ring developed in Kouvola measures the emotional load of its user, aiming to identify work fatigue at an early stage. Unlike traditional smart devices that measure physical stress through heart rate, this ring assesses the electrical conductivity of the skin, indicating mental load. The technology, based on the sympathetic nervous system&#x27;s activity, allows for daily use without cumbersome attachments. Nuanic, the company behind the ring, is conducting academic studies to validate its effectiveness, with promising initial results. The ring aims to facilitate discussions on workplace organization to support recovery and improve employee well-being.",
