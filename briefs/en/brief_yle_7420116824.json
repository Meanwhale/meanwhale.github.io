    "news_text": "Juha-Matti M\u00e4ntyl\u00e4 highlights the excessive dependence on banks for electronic identification in Finland, which has led to serious inconveniences for citizens, such as disrupted birthday plans and unpaid bills. The reliance on bank credentials for accessing public services poses a risk, especially when banking issues arise. While alternatives like mobile identification through telecom operators exist, they often require prior setup with bank credentials. Historical attempts by the Finnish government to establish a digital identification system have repeatedly failed, with the latest initiative for a digital wallet not being completed on time. The current situation underscores the need for citizens to have accounts with multiple banks for personal security, as the government plans to launch a digital wallet across the EU by 2026, but this should not be the sole method of identification.",
