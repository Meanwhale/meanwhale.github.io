    "news_text": "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been instructed by President Donald Trump to stop minting one-cent coins, commonly known as pennies. This decision, announced on Trump&#x27;s Truth Social account, is part of a broader effort to reduce waste in the national budget. The move follows discussions about the high cost of producing pennies, which exceeds their face value. While some argue that pennies are wasteful, others believe they help maintain lower prices and support charitable fundraising. Similar actions have been taken in other countries, like Canada, which discontinued its one-cent coin in 2012.",
