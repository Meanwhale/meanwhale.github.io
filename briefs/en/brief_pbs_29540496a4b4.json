    "news_text": "Amnesty International is urging French lawmakers to reject a bill that would ban headscarves in all sporting competitions, claiming it is discriminatory and targets Muslim women. The bill, backed by right-wing senators, aims to prohibit all religious clothing in competitions and could reignite debates on secularism in France. Sporting federations currently decide on headscarf policies, but the proposed legislation could limit Muslim women&#x27;s participation in sports.",
