    "news_text": "US authorities confirmed that a different strain of avian influenza, D1.1, was detected in dairy cows, indicating the virus has spread from wild birds to cattle. The outbreak began in late 2023 and has affected over 950 cattle herds across 16 states. While the risk to the general public remains low, the potential for human transmission is a concern, especially with the emergence of a second human case of H5N1 in the UK. Governments are ramping up vaccine stocks and surveillance as the situation evolves.",
