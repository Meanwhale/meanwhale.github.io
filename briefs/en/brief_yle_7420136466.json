    "news_text": "In December, two tankers, Volgoneft-212 and Volgoneft-239, released a large amount of heavy fuel into the Black Sea after a storm. The authorities' response was criticized as slow, and cleanup efforts are ongoing. The spill has caused significant environmental damage, including the death of dolphins and birds, and threatens local tourism. Despite claims of no contamination in fish, experts warn that the problem may worsen as temperatures rise in spring, potentially spreading the pollution further.",
