    "news_text": "The Financial Times reports that the United States is against labeling Russia as an aggressor in the upcoming G7 statement. This position includes a refusal to support a UN draft resolution that affirms Ukraine&#x27;s territorial integrity and condemns Russian aggression, according to three diplomatic sources cited by Reuters. Historically, the US has backed similar resolutions advocating for peace in Ukraine. The current resolution reportedly has the backing of over 50 unnamed countries, but it remains unclear when the US will announce its support. Although the US has not signed the resolution yet, there is potential for a change in stance. Recent interactions suggest President Trump is aligning more closely with Russian President Putin&#x27;s views. The G7 has labeled Russia as an aggressor since 2022, and participation from Ukrainian President Zelensky in the G7 meeting remains unconfirmed. Additionally, a planned press conference between Zelensky and US envoy Keith Kellogg has been canceled, with no statements being made at the request of the Americans. Kellogg has met with key Ukrainian military and government leaders during his visit.",
