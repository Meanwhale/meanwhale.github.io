    "news_text": "Youth unemployment in Finland has surged, with rates as high as 36.4% in some areas like R\u00e4yl\u00e4, while regions like \u00c5land maintain low rates around 2-3%. The unemployment situation varies greatly across the country, with major cities experiencing the highest numbers. The overall unemployment rate for those under 25 is concerning, and there are fears that the disparities between eastern and western Finland may persist despite economic efforts. The impact of tourism and economic conditions, particularly with the exclusion of Russian investments, poses further risks to employment stability.",
