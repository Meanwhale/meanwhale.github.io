    "news_text": "On Thursday night, an attack on a Pakistani security outpost near Dera Ismail Khan resulted in the deaths of at least 10 Frontier Constabulary personnel and injuries to seven others. The assault, involving around 20 to 25 militants, was confirmed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's chief minister, Ali Amin Khan Gandapur. The Pakistani Taliban (TTP) claimed responsibility, stating the attack was in retaliation for the killing of their senior leader, Ustad Qureshi, during a military operation. There has been a rise in militant attacks in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban took power in 2021, with the TTP increasingly targeting security forces. Pakistan accuses the TTP of using Afghanistan as a base, a claim denied by the Afghan Taliban. Concerns have been raised about the TTP potentially aligning with global terrorist groups.",
