    "news_text": "Dr. Dominik Hejj recalls the pivotal moment on November 8, 2018, when Viktor Orban and Donald Tusk's paths diverged during a meeting of the EPP in Helsinki. Tusk's condemnation of Orban's stance on democracy and rule of law marked a significant shift in their relationship. Over the years, Hungary's asylum grant to a Polish politician and differing responses to the Ukraine crisis have further strained ties. With Tusk's return to power in Poland and Orban's continued leadership in Hungary, the ideological rift has deepened, complicating their historical bond and leading to a clash over EU policies.",
