    "news_text": "A British archaeologist, Piers Litherland, believes his team may have discovered a second tomb of King Thutmose II in Egypt. This potential find comes shortly after the discovery of a tomb related to Tutankhamun, which had not been found for over a century. Litherland suspects that this second tomb contains the pharaoh&#x27;s mummified body and is located beneath a man-made pile of limestone and rubble designed to resemble a mountain. The first tomb was believed to have been emptied due to flooding shortly after burial. The British-Egyptian team is carefully excavating the site by hand, as tunneling was deemed too dangerous. Litherland expressed his emotional reaction to the find, highlighting the extraordinary nature of uncovering unexpected historical treasures. Thutmose II, known for being the husband of Queen Hatshepsut, is an ancestor of Tutankhamun, whose tomb was discovered in 1922.",
