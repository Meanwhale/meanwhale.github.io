    "news_text": "Associated British Foods (ABF), owner of Primark, is considering increasing investments outside the UK due to concerns over tax rises affecting the High Street. CEO George Weston noted a 43% profit rise to \u00a31.9bn for the year ending 14 September, although challenging weather impacted store visits. ABF is preparing for increased costs following changes in national insurance contributions introduced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Despite these challenges, Primark does not plan to raise prices this year, and sales in the UK and Ireland grew by 0.7%. The British Retail Consortium warned of disappointing October sales, attributing this to consumer hesitance and mild weather affecting winter purchases. Meanwhile, online retailer Asos reported significant losses but noted some positive trends in new clothing ranges.",
