    "news_original_title": "Taiwan detects airplanes, 6 balloons from China near island",
    "news_text": "Taiwan's National Defense Ministry reported the sighting of six Chinese balloons within 24 hours, marking one of the highest daily figures. The balloons were flying at altitudes between 16,000 and 20,000 feet. Additionally, nine Chinese military aircraft and six navy ships were observed nearby. This incident highlights China's ongoing military activities around Taiwan, which it claims as its territory. Taiwan views these balloons as a form of 'grey-zone' harassment. The issue gained global attention in 2023 when the US shot down a balloon it labeled a 'spy balloon.'",
