    "news_text": "Donald Trump has pulled the United States out of the WHO, warning that this move will hinder both parties' ability to tackle global health issues. The withdrawal won't fully take effect until January 2026 due to a congressional resolution. Trump's order pauses US funding to the WHO, which relies heavily on US contributions. Experts warn that this withdrawal could harm US national security and global health efforts, and suggest that the US could instead seek to reform the WHO from within.",
