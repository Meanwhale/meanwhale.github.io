    "news_text": "Donald Trump is expected to announce the US withdrawal from the WHO on January 20, his first day in office for a second term. This move follows an earlier attempt to withdraw in 2020, which was reversed by Joe Biden due to legal constraints. Experts warn that the withdrawal would significantly impact the WHO's budget and its ability to coordinate international health programs, as the US contributes nearly a quarter of its funding. The decision could also weaken US influence in global health and leave the country at a disadvantage during health crises. Some suggest that Trump could instead negotiate reforms within the WHO rather than fully withdrawing.",
