    "news_text": "As the fourth-quarter reporting cycle begins, investors are drawn to companies that have released quarterly figures. Focusing on stocks likely to beat estimates can yield higher gains, as earnings beats boost investor confidence and stock prices. The Federal Reserve's steady rates have made investors cautious about rate-sensitive REITs, which thrive in falling-rate environments. Despite this, the real estate sector shows strength, particularly in residential and retail markets. Companies like Kimco Realty, American Homes 4 Rent, and Vornado Realty Trust are positioned to deliver positive surprises in their upcoming earnings reports, driven by strong demand and favorable market conditions.",
