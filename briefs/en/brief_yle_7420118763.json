    "news_text": "The Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority was prompted to investigate Nordea Bank's service disruptions caused by denial of service attacks, which lasted for weeks. Antti Lindtman, Chairman of the Banking Supervisory Board, noted the unprecedented scale and intensity of the attacks, suggesting they were orchestrated by a well-resourced operator possibly linked to Russia. While the Financial Supervisory Authority found no deficiencies in Nordea's operations, it emphasized the need for proactive planning and testing of systems to mitigate such attacks. The situation has drawn attention from various governmental bodies, and a preliminary investigation into the attacks has been initiated. The attackers' motives may include creating distrust and insecurity within the financial sector.",
