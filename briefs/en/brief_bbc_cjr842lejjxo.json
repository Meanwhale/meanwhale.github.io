    "news_text": "Newly released MI5 files reveal that Queen Elizabeth II was kept in the dark for almost ten years about Anthony Blunt, a senior courtier and art historian, confessing to being a Soviet spy since the 1930s. Although Blunt admitted to MI5 in 1964 that he had spied for the Russians during World War Two, the Queen was only informed in the 1970s. When she learned the full story, she remained calm and unsurprised. The decision to inform her was made due to concerns that the truth would come out following Blunt's death. Blunt had been under suspicion since 1951, and his confession was largely kept from the public until it was revealed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1979.",
