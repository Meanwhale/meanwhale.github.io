    "news_text": "Sally Leskinen, the welfare area director of South Karelia, is calling for a change in the law that governs welfare area funding, addressing her concerns to Finance Minister Riikka Purra and Prime Minister Petteri Orpo. She argues that the current timeline for achieving budget savings is unrealistic and would lead to neglect of residents' statutory services. Leskinen has proposed two alternative amendments: extending the deadline for covering deficits by two years or implementing a proactive assessment procedure. She emphasizes that her proposals are based on thorough financial analysis, which indicates that adhering to the original timeline would severely compromise services and lead to significant staff layoffs. Leskinen has stated she would resign if the deficit coverage obligation remains unchanged, asserting that her commitment is to serve the residents responsibly. However, the government has not initiated any preparations for such legal changes, and officials indicate that the current stance is not to pursue this type of amendment.",
