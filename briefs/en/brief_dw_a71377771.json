    "news_text": "In 2024, solar energy became the largest source of electricity in the European Union, surpassing coal for the first time, according to a report by Ember. Solar energy now accounts for 11% of the EU's electricity supply, contributing to a total renewable energy share of 47%, up from 34% in 2019. The report also noted a significant decline in fossil fuel dependency, with coal generating only 10% of power and gas generation falling for the fifth consecutive year. The European Green Deal and rising gas prices due to geopolitical tensions have accelerated this transition to clean energy, allowing the EU to avoid nearly $61 billion in fossil fuel imports since 2019. EU leaders emphasize the importance of clean energy for energy independence and climate leadership.",
