    "news_original_title": "Slovak government teeters as more mass protests planned",
    "news_text": "Protests against the Slovak government are anticipated in over 50 locations as citizens react to Prime Minister Robert Fico's pro-Russian stance and perceived erosion of democratic values. Fico's recent visit to Moscow and his government's policies have raised concerns about a shift away from the EU and NATO. The protests are also fueled by a public dispute with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and internal coalition tensions. Analysts suggest that Fico's extreme measures may not quell dissent, and the opposition is pushing for a no-confidence vote amid fears of a government collapse. The political landscape remains unstable, with potential early elections on the horizon.",
