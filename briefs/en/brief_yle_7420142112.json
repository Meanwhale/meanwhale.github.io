    "news_text": "New information has emerged regarding the Black Hawk helicopter crash in Washington, where the ADS-B tracking system was not active at the time of impact. Senator Ted Cruz reported that military regulations allow the ADS-B system to be turned off. Although the helicopter had a secondary radar transponder, it was not as effective as the ADS-B system. The helicopter was also flying above the maximum altitude allowed before the collision. This incident marks the most serious flight crash in the U.S. in over twenty years, resulting in the deaths of all 67 passengers on both the helicopter and the passenger plane.",
