    "news_text": "Scientists warn that frogs, lizards, snakes, and other pests are being transported worldwide on cut flowers and potted plants, potentially harming ecosystems. Notable incidents include a tree frog found in Sheffield and snakes in olive trees shipped across Europe.

Researchers from the University of Cambridge emphasize the need for improved standards and better data collection to address the risks posed by these 'hitchhiking intruders.'",
