    "news_text": "A study suggests that 31,000 to 35,800 new dwellings are needed yearly in Manner-Finland, with a total of 600,000 to 700,000 required by 2045. Factors affecting housing demand include net immigration and internal migration, particularly in urban areas like Helsinki and Tampere. The demand for new dwellings has fallen due to reduced interest from residential investors, leading to a high number of unsold properties. The construction company YIT has responded by reducing its stock of empty dwellings through discounts, although overall housing construction remains low.",
