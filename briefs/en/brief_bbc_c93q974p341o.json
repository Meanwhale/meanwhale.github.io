    "news_text": "The UK Ministry of Defence and Rolls-Royce have finalized a \u00a39bn contract for nuclear submarine reactors, the largest ever between the two. The eight-year agreement, named Unity, aims to enhance the efficiency and environmental sustainability of reactor design, manufacturing, and support services. It is expected to create over 1,000 jobs in the UK and protect an additional 4,000 roles. The deal will streamline previous contracts, leading to \u00a3400m in savings, while supporting the Royal Navy's submarine fleet and facilitating the construction of new Dreadnought Class submarines. Rolls-Royce will also provide reactors for a new fleet under the Aukus defense alliance involving the UK, US, and Australia. The investment is seen as a boost for British business and national security.",
