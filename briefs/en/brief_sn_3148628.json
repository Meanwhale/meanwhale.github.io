    "news_text": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has banned the synthetic dye Red No. 3, primarily used in candies and other food products, due to studies linking high exposure to cancer in rats. While human exposure is typically lower and evidence of harm is inconclusive, the FDA is legally required to prohibit food additives that may cause cancer. The ban follows California's previous restrictions on the dye and other synthetic colors due to concerns about neurobehavioral issues in children. Food manufacturers have two years to reformulate products without Red No. 3.",
