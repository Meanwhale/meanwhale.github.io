    "news_text": "Hackmanite plates manufactured at the University of Turku were launched into space by SpaceX to measure UV radiation. The launch occurred at 4:29 a.m. and the plates will be installed on the International Space Station for testing. Professor Mika Lastusaari expressed gratitude for the opportunity to test this material, which has been in development since 2014. The project, funded by the European Space Agency, aims to determine the suitability of hackmanite for measuring UV radiation in space, as such measurements are not possible on Earth. Dr. Sami Vuore noted that hackmanite can withstand extreme space conditions and does not require electricity for measurements. The research team is also exploring other potential uses for hackmanite, including in X-ray imaging and lighting.",
