    "news_text": "According to a Ukrainian newspaper, the US is trying to finalize a peace agreement by Russia's victory day on May 9. President Trump has decided to end most foreign aid, including military and economic assistance to Ukraine, leading to uncertainty about the future of support. Experts suggest this could send a message to Russia that Ukraine may be forced into unfavorable negotiations. European leaders are under pressure to support Ukraine, but there are concerns about the adequacy of military aid. Reports indicate that negotiations may begin soon, with potential agreements involving Ukraine's non-alignment with NATO while still pursuing EU membership. However, the Ukrainian government has denied these claims, and the situation remains precarious.",
