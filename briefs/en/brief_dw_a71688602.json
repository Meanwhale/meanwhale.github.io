    "news_text": "Lebanon&#x27;s leadership demands Israel fulfill the ceasefire agreement by withdrawing troops, asserting the Lebanese army&#x27;s readiness to secure the border. Israel, however, retains its forces in strategic locations, citing security threats from Hezbollah. The UN urges compliance with Resolution 1701, which mandates the withdrawal of Israeli troops and deployment of UNIFIL and Lebanese forces. Analysts warn that Israel&#x27;s presence could destabilize Lebanon politically and lead to the emergence of armed groups, echoing past conflicts. Hezbollah&#x27;s leadership threatens action if Israel does not comply with the ceasefire terms, emphasizing the ongoing tensions in the region.",
