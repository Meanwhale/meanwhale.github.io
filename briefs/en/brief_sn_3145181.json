    "news_text": "Recent studies indicate that weekly insulin injections could reduce the burden of daily shots for some diabetes patients. Two companies have developed weekly formulations, with Eli Lilly's efsitora showing effectiveness for type 2 diabetes but raising safety concerns for type 1 diabetes due to increased hypoglycemia risks. Novo Nordisk's icodec has been approved in some countries but not yet in the U.S. The complexity of diabetes management, particularly for type 1, raises questions about the appropriateness of weekly insulin. Experts emphasize the need for precise dosing and better access to diabetes education and continuous glucose monitoring to improve patient care.",
