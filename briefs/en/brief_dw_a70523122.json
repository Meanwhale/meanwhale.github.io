    "news_text": "On Thursday, a group of Russian lawmakers approved legislation aimed at prohibiting child-free propaganda, with the intent to shield the younger generation from ideologies promoting childlessness. Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the Duma, emphasized the need for a unified legal framework to protect children and traditional values, likening the situation to a war on the ideological front. The bill, which has passed its first reading, imposes fines for promoting child-free content, with penalties reaching up to 400,000 rubles for individuals and five million rubles for businesses. Violators, including foreigners, could face deportation. This legislative move follows a significant decline in Russia's birth rate and reflects concerns about societal influences on family planning.",
