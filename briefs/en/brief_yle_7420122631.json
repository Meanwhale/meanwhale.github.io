    "news_header": "Trump's support among Latin voters has increased significantly, with a notable rise among those under 30, while his popularity remains low among black voters.",
    "news_text": "A Reuters survey indicates that Trump's support among Latin voters has grown by 13 percentage points since 2020, improving his future prospects. Additionally, he has gained 6 percentage points among voters under 30. In a hypothetical matchup, Trump would lead with 54-34 votes. However, women would favor Harris, and Trump has not improved his standing among black voters. Ongoing door surveys across the U.S. provide insights into voting behavior, although they may not be entirely accurate.",
