    "news_text": "The EU Agricultural and Fisheries Council has approved fishing quotas for the Baltic Sea by 2025, which will significantly increase fishing opportunities, particularly for salmon across all of Finland's maritime areas, including the Arctic Sea and Kvarken region. Minister Sari Essayah emphasized the importance of this decision for the business sector. Fishing in the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Finland has increased by 108%, with measures taken to protect spawning times for certain species. The WWF has raised concerns about the deteriorating situation in the Baltic Sea and has called for cuts in fishing. Finland has implemented a temporary ban on certain fishing activities to protect fish spawning. The fishing quotas for salmon have been reduced by 36%, with a total of 34,787 salmon allowed, of which Finland's share is 8,989. This decision aims to support the recovery of salmon populations, particularly in the Tornio River, where salmon numbers have been low. Finnish officials played a key role in shaping the fishing quotas for the upcoming year.",
