    "news_text": "Lidia Thorpe, an Aboriginal senator, faced backlash after heckling King Charles at a royal event, stating 'you are not my king' and 'this is not your land.' While some activists praised her protest, others, including prominent Aboriginal figures, condemned it as disrespectful. Thorpe later deleted a violent cartoon of the King posted by a staff member, claiming it was inappropriate. She defended her actions, emphasizing the need for the King to acknowledge historical injustices. Australian politicians, including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, criticized her behavior, while Thorpe remained defiant, asserting her commitment to truth-telling.",
