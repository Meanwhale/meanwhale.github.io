    "news_text": "A German court has ruled that Birkenstocks do not qualify as works of art, rejecting the company&#x27;s claim for copyright protection against copycat versions. Birkenstock argued that its sandals, which have gained popularity recently, especially after being featured in the Barbie movie, should be classified as art. However, the judge stated that the sandals are practical design items, not artistic creations. This ruling follows previous court decisions, with the first court siding with Birkenstock and the second reversing that decision. Birkenstock plans to continue its legal efforts to protect its designs from imitation.",
