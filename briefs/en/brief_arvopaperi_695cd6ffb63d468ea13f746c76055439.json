    "news_text": "In Finland, the volume of fund savings has grown considerably over the past 15 years, with a notable increase in the capital held in funds. Investor Merja M\u00e4hkk\u00e4 believes that fund-saving is suitable for everyone, especially for those not keen on active stock-picking.

Professor Elias Rantapulka highlights the necessity of understanding one&#x27;s risk tolerance, while also noting common mistakes made by novice fund investors.",
