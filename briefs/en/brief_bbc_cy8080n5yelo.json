    "news_text": "The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) ruled that Volkswagen Finance inadequately handled cases of vulnerable customers who had their cars repossessed with little warning. One customer, who disclosed personal struggles, reported a lack of empathy from the firm. The FCA mandated VW Finance to pay \u00a321.5m in compensation to around 110,000 affected customers and imposed a \u00a35.4m fine. The company acknowledged its failures and claimed to have made significant improvements in its operations. The FCA's findings highlighted that VW Finance often sent generic communications and ignored customers seeking repayment options. This incident follows previous FCA actions against other finance firms for similar issues.",
