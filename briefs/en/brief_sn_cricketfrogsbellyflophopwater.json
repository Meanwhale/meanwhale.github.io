    "news_text": "A new study reveals that cricket frogs (Acris crepitans) do not walk or hop on water as previously thought. Instead, they employ a movement known as 'porpoising,' where they leap in and out of the water to travel. Researchers filmed the frogs in a controlled environment and found that they submerge their bodies between jumps, pushing off with their back legs and using their front legs to stabilize before landing. This method allows them to conserve energy, similar to dolphins and seals, although they pause between jumps, which differentiates their movement from traditional porpoising.",
