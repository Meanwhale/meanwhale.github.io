    "news_text": "Professor Klaus Kultti from the University of Helsinki suggests that betting on elections reflects people's behavior more accurately than opinion polls. With over $2 billion wagered on platforms like Polymarket, betting odds for Donald Trump have surged, indicating a perception of him as a likely winner, despite polls favoring Kamala Harris. Kultti emphasizes that betting requires financial commitment, making it a more genuine indicator of voter sentiment. Historical studies show that betting odds have been more accurate than polls, especially in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, betting can be manipulated, as seen with significant bets on Trump that coincided with rising odds. The reliability of betting statistics also depends on the number of participants, as more bettors reduce the likelihood of manipulation. In the U.S., betting on elections has faced restrictions, but recent legal changes may allow it to expand. Ultimately, while betting odds can suggest probable outcomes, they are not infallible, as demonstrated in the 2016 election where Trump won despite lower odds.",
