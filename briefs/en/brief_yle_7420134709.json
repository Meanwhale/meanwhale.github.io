    "news_text": "Recent discoveries by scientists have revealed new species such as a soft-haired vampire urchin and a pirate spider, contributing to the understanding of biodiversity. Despite having identified only about 10% of all species on Earth, hundreds of new species were added to the existing list of 2.2 million last year. Many of these newly discovered species, including a unique hedgehog and a dog from the Mekong region, face threats from habitat destruction and illegal wildlife trafficking. The importance of protecting endangered species and funding research for new discoveries is emphasized, as human activities have accelerated species extinction rates significantly. Additionally, two new spider species were found on St. Helena, and a new snake in Nepal was humorously named after actor Leonardo DiCaprio in recognition of his environmental activism.",
