    "news_text": "A report by India Hate Lab revealed a 74% increase in hate speech instances against minorities in India in 2024, peaking during national elections. The report documented 1,165 instances, primarily targeting Muslims (98.5% of cases). Politicians, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, were noted as frequent perpetrators. The report highlighted that most hate speech events occurred in states governed by Modi&#x27;s party. Despite accusations of Islamophobia, the ruling BJP denied these claims, asserting the strength of India&#x27;s legal system. The report also indicated a significant rise in dangerous speech patterns compared to 2023, with calls for violence against Muslims.",
