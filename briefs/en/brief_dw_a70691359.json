    "news_text": "LignoSat, the first wooden satellite, was launched by researchers from Kyoto University to demonstrate that wood can be used in space. Made from honoki, a type of magnolia, LignoSat aims to explore the potential of wood for future space habitats. The satellite will orbit Earth for six months, assessing wood's durability and its ability to mitigate space radiation. Researchers believe that wood could offer environmental benefits over traditional metal satellites. The project could also lead to tree planting initiatives on the Moon and Mars in the future.",
