    "news_text": "Negotiations are continuing this autumn to finalize decisions regarding the construction costs of the rapid train line between Turku and Helsinki. Municipalities including Turku, Salo, Espoo, Lohja, Vihti, and Kirkkonummi are unhappy with a preliminary agreement made in the summer, which involved an \u20ac800 million cost-sharing arrangement between the state and the municipalities. The municipalities aim to lessen their financial burden and are preparing for the project with debt financing. Discussions are ongoing about how to distribute costs for the first phase of construction, estimated at \u20ac1.3 billion, which includes building a railroad between Espoo and Lohja and a partial double track between Salo and Hajala. The state has allocated $400 million, but an additional $500 million is needed. Helsinki will not participate in the construction phase, and the project previously lacked EU funding support.",
