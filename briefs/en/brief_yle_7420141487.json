    "news_text": "Research from the University of Tampere reveals that happiness acts as a protective factor against social media addiction, whereas social media bubbles\u2014where users are grouped with like-minded individuals\u2014heighten the risk of addiction. The study involved two parts: one surveyed six European countries, and the other tracked Finnish internet usage over three years. It found that internet addiction often goes unnoticed, with 5-50% of individuals affected. The study also noted that while social media can create a sense of community, it may lead to increased dependency, particularly among those with mental health challenges. Interestingly, happy individuals were found to be less susceptible to addiction, suggesting they may engage with the internet differently.",
