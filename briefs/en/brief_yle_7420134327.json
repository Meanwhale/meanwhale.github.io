    "news_text": "Starting June 12, 2025, stock exchange electricity prices will be quoted in 15-minute intervals instead of hourly, in compliance with European legislation. This change will affect consumer electricity contracts, requiring suppliers to offer products based on 15-minute consumption data. Currently, around 3.9 million electric meters in Finland can register consumption in 15-minute periods. The transition is already underway, with the first steps taken in May 2023, and all meters are expected to be compliant by the end of 2028. This shift is driven by the need to adapt to variable renewable energy production.",
