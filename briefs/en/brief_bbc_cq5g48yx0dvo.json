    "news_text": "Maros Sefcovic, the EU's new trade chief, mentioned the possibility of the UK joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM) during discussions aimed at resetting UK-EU relations post-Brexit. This convention would allow tariff-free trade by sourcing materials from various countries. While the UK government is consulting businesses about the benefits of PEM, no decision has been made yet. The Conservatives previously did not pursue PEM, but some businesses believe it could help re-establish supply chains disrupted by customs barriers. Sefcovic emphasized that the UK needs to formulate its position, and discussions about a veterinary agreement and fisheries are also ongoing. He noted that relations between the UK and EU are improving.",
