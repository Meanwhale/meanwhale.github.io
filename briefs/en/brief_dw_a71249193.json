    "news_text": "A recent suite of reviews in the journal Neuron investigates the aging of the brain, identifying both physical and biological changes that contribute to cognitive decline. Key factors include DNA damage, inflammation, and the brain's waste clearance efficiency. With predictions of 152 million people experiencing cognitive decline by 2050, understanding these mechanisms is crucial. While lifestyle choices can impact brain health, genetics play a fundamental role in determining the aging process. The reviews also highlight the need for further research on normal cognitive decline in the absence of disease.",
