    "news_text": "Los Angeles, traditionally the heart of American car culture, is attempting to shift towards cycling and public transit in preparation for the 2028 Olympics. Despite its sunny weather being ideal for cycling, only a small percentage of residents use bikes for commuting. The city has launched the 'Twenty-eight by '28' plan to expand mass transit and bike lanes, but resistance from car enthusiasts remains. While some residents support the changes, others fear increased traffic congestion. Mayor Karen Bass is optimistic about a 'transit first' Olympics, but concerns linger about the pace of improvements and funding needed to realize these goals.",
