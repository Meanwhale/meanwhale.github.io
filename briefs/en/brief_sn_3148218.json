    "news_text": "Flying cars, a concept long associated with science fiction, are closer to reality as technology has advanced. Aerospace engineers suggest that these vehicles could combine features of airplanes and helicopters, allowing for vertical takeoff and landing. Companies are developing prototypes, and while personal flying cars may be expensive, rideshare services for flying cars could emerge in the next decade. The FAA is also working on regulations for air taxis, but challenges such as battery efficiency and safety testing remain.",
