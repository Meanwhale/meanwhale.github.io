    "news_text": "With Donald Trump back in the presidency, experts anticipate significant changes to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), a key environmental law. The ESA, which has been effective in protecting over 1,700 species, may face alterations similar to those seen during Trump's first term. Legal scholars predict modifications to the law's language and enforcement, potentially undermining wildlife protections. The administration's focus on economic impacts and reduced funding for conservation efforts could further threaten at-risk species. Concerns also arise over the management of species like the grizzly bear, as political pressures may lead to delisting and increased hunting.",
