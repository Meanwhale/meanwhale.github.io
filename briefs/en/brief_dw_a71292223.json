    "news_text": "China has installed a large floating structure in contested waters with South Korea, reminiscent of tactics used to assert control in the South China Sea. Analysts suggest this move may be aimed at advancing China's territorial claims amid South Korea's political instability. The structure, described as a 'fishing support facility' by Beijing, has led to diplomatic protests from Seoul. The area is governed by a 2001 agreement that prohibits construction and resource development, which China appears to be violating. Experts warn that this could be part of a broader strategy by China to extend its jurisdiction and assert claims over the region.",
