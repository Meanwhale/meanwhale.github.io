    "news_text": "The Lebanese health ministry reported that at least 60 people have been killed in recent Israeli air strikes targeting the Bekaa Valley, particularly the Baalbek region, which is a Hezbollah stronghold. Among the deceased are two children, and 58 others have been wounded. Rescue operations are ongoing, but efforts are hindered by the intensity of the attacks, described as the most violent in the area since the conflict escalated last month. The strikes have affected 16 areas, with the town of Al-Allaq suffering the most casualties. The Israeli military has conducted extensive air strikes across Lebanon over the past five weeks, claiming to target Hezbollah operatives and infrastructure. The conflict has led to significant civilian casualties, with over 2,700 reported dead and 12,400 injured in Lebanon since the escalation began. Additionally, around 1.3 million people have been internally displaced due to the ongoing violence.",
