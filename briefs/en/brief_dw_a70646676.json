    "news_text": "Volkswagen, a symbol of German engineering, is facing an uncertain future as the global auto market shifts from internal combustion engines to electric mobility. The company reported its least profitable quarter in years, with a 64% profit drop to \u20ac1.58 billion and a slight revenue decline. Talks of mass layoffs and plant closures are underway, as management seeks cost reductions amid weakening demand and increased competition from Chinese manufacturers.

However, competition from Chinese firms is expected to intensify.",
