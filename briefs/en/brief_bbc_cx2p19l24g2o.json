    "news_text": "President Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC), claiming its actions against the US and Israel are illegitimate. The order restricts financial and visa access for those aiding ICC investigations into American citizens or allies. This move coincided with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Washington, following the ICC's issuance of an arrest warrant for him over alleged war crimes in Gaza. The ICC has also pursued charges against Hamas leaders. The US and Israel are not ICC members, but over 120 countries are. The Netherlands expressed regret over the sanctions, emphasizing the court's role in combating impunity. Trump's order argues that the ICC's actions threaten US sovereignty and national security. The situation is further complicated by Trump's controversial proposal to 'take over' Gaza, which has drawn criticism from Arab leaders and the UN.",
