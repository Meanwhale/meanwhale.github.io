    "news_text": "In democratic elections, votes are counted only after polling stations close, leading to potential delays, especially with mail ballots. Candidates like Donald Trump may raise expectations for quick results, but official counts can take days or weeks. Swing states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have specific rules for counting mail ballots, often resulting in shifts in lead due to differing voting methods between parties. The counting process involves poll workers and technology to ensure accuracy, and recounts may occur if margins are narrow. Media outlets and analysts monitor the process, and the certification of results is crucial for determining electoral representatives.",
