    "news_text": "The Economic Policy Assessment Council has warned that further adjustment measures that undermine overall demand are not appropriate at this time. Finance Minister Riikka Purra stated that the next government will need to adapt around EUR 9 billion, similar to what was agreed by the previous administration. She highlighted the changing security situation and increasing pressure on defense spending as reasons for this need. Purra expressed her willingness to support necessary adjustments in the next government, despite the political challenges. The council emphasized the importance of avoiding new actions while acknowledging existing uncertainties, and Purra reiterated the goal of halting public debt growth relative to national product by 2027.",
