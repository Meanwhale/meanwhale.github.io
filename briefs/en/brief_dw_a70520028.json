    "news_text": "A court in Bangladesh has issued an arrest warrant for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is accused of crimes against humanity related to violent clashes that occurred during her rule. Hasina, 77, fled to India in August after being ousted by a student-led uprising. The chief prosecutor stated that the warrant requires her appearance in court on November 18. The unrest began over public-sector job quotas and escalated into broader protests against her government, which had been marked by human rights abuses. An extradition treaty exists between India and Bangladesh, but it includes a clause that could prevent her extradition if the charges are deemed political. The new caretaker government is led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, who aims to restore democracy and prepare for parliamentary elections.",
