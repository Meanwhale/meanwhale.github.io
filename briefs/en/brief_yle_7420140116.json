    "news_text": "The apocalypse clock, maintained by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, is now set at 89 seconds to midnight, indicating a heightened risk of global catastrophe. This marks the closest the clock has been to midnight in its history, reflecting concerns about nuclear war and other disasters. Critics argue that the clock lacks objective measures of global security, noting that during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, conditions were perceived as safer than they are today.",
