    "news_text": "Michel Barnier, recently appointed as France's Prime Minister, is tasked with navigating the 2025 budget through a parliament where he lacks a majority. The budget deficit is projected to exceed 6% of GDP, up from an earlier estimate of 4.4%. Barnier missed the October 1 deadline for budget plans and will present them on October 10. France's public debt has risen significantly, attributed to pandemic-related spending and subsidies following the Ukraine crisis. Barnier aims to reduce the deficit to 5% next year and 3% by 2029, primarily through spending cuts and tax increases. However, opinions vary on the effectiveness of these measures, with concerns about potential recession from drastic spending cuts. The left-wing opposition has announced plans for a no-confidence vote, complicating Barnier's efforts. Despite challenges, some analysts believe Barnier will present a solid plan to appease investors and the EU.",
