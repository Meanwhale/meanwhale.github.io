    "news_text": "The S group sells women's handbags that closely resemble well-known luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel, and Longchamp, raising legal questions about copyright and trademark infringement. Legal expert Heidi H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen from the University of Turku notes that while trends can be replicated, products protected by copyright should not be copied. The similarity of the S group's products to the Longchamp Le Pliage, which has a 3D trademark, puts them in a legal grey area. Although the S group's bags are significantly cheaper, authorities in France monitor the sale of imitations and counterfeits. Ultimately, legal decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis.",
