ByteDance must sell its US subsidiary by January 19 or face a ban due to security concerns linked to the Chinese government. TikTok's influence is growing globally, with previous bans in countries like India and Romania.",
    "news_text": "TikTok's future in the US is uncertain as it faces a potential ban unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sells its American subsidiary by January 19. This decision stems from concerns that ByteDance may share sensitive data with the Chinese government. While TikTok remains popular, with around 170 million users in the US, the company has appealed against the law in the Supreme Court. The app has faced bans in other countries, including India and Romania, due to security concerns and political influence. Experts suggest that the situation could impact EU policies as well.",
