    "news_text": "Boeing's CEO Kelly Ortberg has indicated that the company is facing significant challenges, with losses reaching approximately $6 billion. Ortberg, who became CEO in August, is focused on stabilizing the firm and repairing its reputation, which has been damaged by safety and manufacturing concerns. The company is currently dealing with a strike involving over 30,000 workers that has halted aircraft production. As workers prepare to vote on a new pay proposal, which includes a 35% raise over four years, Ortberg expressed hope for its approval but acknowledged ongoing hurdles. He noted that Boeing is burdened with excessive debt and has disappointed customers due to performance issues. Recent crises, including a mid-air incident and problems with its Starliner space vessel, have exacerbated the situation. Despite a backlog of 5,400 orders, Ortberg cautioned that restarting production after the strike would be challenging. The company also plans to cut about 10% of its workforce, and Ortberg emphasized the need for a fundamental culture change to address ongoing issues.",
