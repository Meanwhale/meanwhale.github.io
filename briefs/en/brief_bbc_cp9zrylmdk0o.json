    "news_text": "Striking Boeing workers, represented by the IAM union, have rejected a new offer that included a 35% pay rise over four years, with 64% voting against it. The strike, which began on September 13, involves over 30,000 employees and follows a previous offer that was rejected by 95% of workers. Boeing's CEO, Kelly Ortberg, warned of severe financial losses amounting to roughly $6 billion and stated that the company is at a 'crossroads.' The strike is costing Boeing $100 million a day and has compounded existing issues related to manufacturing and safety concerns. The company plans to cut about 10% of its workforce and has already placed thousands on furlough. Suppliers are also feeling the effects, with layoffs possible if the strike continues.",
