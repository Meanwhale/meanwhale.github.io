    "news_text": "Brazil's Supreme Court has lifted a month-long suspension on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) after the company began complying with court rulings. Justice Alexandre de Moraes authorized the platform's return, noting that X had settled millions in fines for previous non-compliance. X expressed pride in returning to Brazil, emphasizing its commitment to freedom of speech within legal boundaries. The suspension was initially ordered due to X's failure to appoint a legal representative in Brazil and to address hate speech issues. Following the ruling, X appointed a legal representative, fulfilling Brazilian law requirements.",
