    "news_text": "Taffel, a brand owned by Orkla, is responding to consumer preferences by reducing the packaging size of its largest scissors from 325 grams to between 250-270 grams. This decision is supported by sales data and consumer research indicating a demand for smaller sizes. The largest packaging sizes of competing brands, Estrella and Pringles, are 275 grams and 200 grams, respectively. Taffel will also introduce two smaller packaging sizes alongside the new larger sizes, with changes expected to roll out in the autumn and next year. While it is unclear if prices will decrease with the smaller packaging, the final retail prices will be determined by stores.",
