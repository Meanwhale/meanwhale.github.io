    "news_original_title": "Can resumption of oil production save South Sudan\u2019s economy?",
    "news_text": "South Sudan, the world's youngest nation, restarted oil production on January 8, 2025, after a year-long shutdown caused by conflict in neighboring Sudan. Despite optimism from officials like Petroleum Minister Puot Kang Chol, skepticism remains as the country grapples with economic challenges, corruption, and institutional weaknesses. The initial production target is 90,000 barrels per day, significantly lower than pre-shutdown levels. Analysts warn that increased oil revenues may not benefit the population due to historical corruption and mismanagement. South Sudan's economy has contracted by 5% during the shutdown, and the government is urged to diversify its revenue sources beyond oil.",
