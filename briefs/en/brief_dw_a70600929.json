    "news_text": "Daniel Chapo, a 47-year-old candidate from Mozambique's ruling Frelimo party, has been declared the winner of the presidential election, securing 70.67% of the vote. His election is contested by opposition leader Venancio Mondlane, who claims electoral fraud and manipulation. The situation is tense, with concerns raised by EU officials regarding the legitimacy of the polls. Chapo, who has limited political experience, is set to take office in January, succeeding President Nyusi, who is stepping down after two terms. Political analysts warn of increasing polarization in the country and emphasize the need for dialogue to resolve the election disputes. Chapo is viewed as a business-friendly candidate and is expected to address security issues, particularly in Cabo Delgado, where Islamist insurgents have disrupted gas projects.",
