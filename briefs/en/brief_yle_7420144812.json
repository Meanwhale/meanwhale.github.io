Yemeni Minister of Information calls for the arrest of Huthi leaders attending the funeral. The Huthi rebels, supported by Iran, have not officially confirmed their attendance, but reports indicate a Yemeni delegation may arrive. Nasrallah died in an Israeli bombing last September. Both Huthi rebels and Hezbollah attacked Israel during the Gaza war, affecting global trade through the Red Sea.",
