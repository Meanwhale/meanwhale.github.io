    "news_text": "Research by Katja Rinta-Antila from the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 indicates that young individuals who begin sports early and engage in competitive activities are more likely to remain in sports clubs. The study surveyed over six hundred participants aged 15 and 19, revealing that the primary reason for leaving sports clubs is the increased focus on studies during teenage years. Other factors include injuries and a sense of saturation. Boys tend to participate more than girls, with parental support playing a crucial role in girls' continued involvement. The study suggests that sports clubs should offer more flexible participation options to accommodate academic commitments and encourage young people to stay active.",
