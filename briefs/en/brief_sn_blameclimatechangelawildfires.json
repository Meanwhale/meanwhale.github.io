    "news_text": "The wildfire season in Los Angeles now lasts about 23 days longer than in preindustrial times, with recent fires causing at least 28 deaths and destroying over 16,000 structures. A World Weather Attribution analysis indicates that human-caused climate change has made the hot, dry, and windy conditions driving these fires more likely. The Santa Ana winds, which can reach speeds of 160 km/h, have further intensified the situation. Researchers found that climate change has increased the probability of such conditions by 35% and their intensity by 6% compared to preindustrial levels. The study highlights the critical link between climate change and the worsening wildfire risks in Southern California.",
