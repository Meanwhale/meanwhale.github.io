    "news_text": "Tanner Fox and Jose Lopez pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of Sikh businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik in British Columbia Supreme Court, just before their trial for first-degree murder. A violent altercation occurred between the two in the courtroom following their pleas. Malik was shot outside his family business in July 2022. He had previously been acquitted of charges related to a deadly bombing in 1985. The hitmen were contracted to kill Malik, although it remains unclear who hired them. Malik's family is urging for the identification and prosecution of those responsible for orchestrating the murder. The case will return to court for sentencing on October 31, with the guilty pleas ensuring life sentences for the hitmen.",
