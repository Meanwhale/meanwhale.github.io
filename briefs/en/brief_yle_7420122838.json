    "news_text": "Olaf Scholz's government, a coalition of Social Democrats, Greens, and Liberals, is struggling with disagreements, particularly between Finance Minister Christian Lindner and the other parties. Lindner has called for new elections, which Scholz rejected, leading to the dismissal of all FDP ministers. The coalition is also facing challenges regarding the 2025 budget and economic policies. Scholz plans to hold a vote of confidence in January, and if the coalition loses support, early elections may occur by March. Currently, the coalition's support is around 30%, while the opposition CDU/CSU has over 30%.",
