    "news_text": "From the early 19th century to the 1970s, indigenous children in the U.S. were forcibly taken to schools where they were converted to Christianity and European culture, facing severe violence. President Joe Biden recently apologized for these actions, acknowledging the historical trauma and calling it a significant period in U.S. history. His administration aims to improve the status of indigenous peoples, including extending their sovereignty and protecting sacred objects. Previous U.S. presidents have also issued apologies for various injustices, but many did not include compensation for affected groups.",
