    "news_text": "Jari Ehrnrooth argues that Finland is living beyond its means because it lacks a free market in politics, which has resulted in continuous deficit budgets and over-indebtedness. He criticizes the political class for failing to adjust expenditures to revenues and for perpetuating a consensus-driven democracy that stifles true competition and social reforms. The political discourse often mixes ideals with reality, creating a facade of hope that does not align with the actual state of governance. Ehrnrooth calls for a new social model for Finland to address these issues.",
