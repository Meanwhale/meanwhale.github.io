    "news_text": "The Pentagon has revoked the security detail and clearance for retired General Mark Milley, a former top military commander critical of President Trump. This decision, directed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, follows Trump's pattern of revoking protections for officials he has clashed with. Milley, who served as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff during Trump's first term, was accused by Trump of treason for calls with his Chinese counterpart. Milley has publicly criticized Trump, calling him a 'fascist' and stating that the military does not serve a 'wannabe dictator'. In response to potential retribution from Trump, outgoing President Biden issued a pre-emptive pardon for Milley and others. The Defense Department is investigating Milley's conduct and reviewing his military grade.",
