    "news_text": "Historians, aided by AI, analyzed a collection of 359 astronomy textbooks published between 1472 and 1650 to understand the dissemination of astronomical knowledge in Europe during the early 1500s. The study challenges the notion of individual scientific geniuses, showing that knowledge was widely shared across disciplines and regions. Key findings include the influence of Wittenberg's textbooks on a standardized approach to astronomy across Europe, despite the sociopolitical divisions of the time. The research highlights the potential of AI as a collaborative tool for historians, while emphasizing the importance of human oversight in interpreting historical data.",
