    "news_text": "A Redfin report reveals that the U.S. housing turnover rate is at its lowest in 30 years, with only 25 out of every 1,000 homes sold in the first eight months of 2024. This represents a 37.5% decrease from the pandemic surge in 2021 and a 31% drop from 2019. Contributing factors include stagnant demand for homes needing repairs, low listing rates, and homeowners reluctant to sell due to favorable mortgage rates. Suburban and rural homes are selling slightly more than urban ones. Cities in the Sun Belt and near New York have higher turnover rates, while California has the lowest, attributed to tax laws that discourage selling. Austin saw the most significant decline in turnover, dropping 49% since 2019.",
