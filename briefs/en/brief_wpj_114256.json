    "news_text": "According to a Redfin report, the U.S. housing turnover rate has dropped to 25 out of every 1,000 homes in the first eight months of 2024, the lowest in 30 years. This represents a 37.5% decrease from the pandemic surge in 2021 and a 31% decrease from 2019. Factors contributing to this decline include stagnant listings, homeowners locked into low mortgage rates, and a significant drop in homes listed for sale. Suburban and rural homes are selling slightly more often than urban homes, with cities like Phoenix and Newark showing higher turnover rates. California has the lowest turnover rates, influenced by tax laws that discourage selling. Austin saw the most significant decline in turnover, dropping 49% from 2019.",
