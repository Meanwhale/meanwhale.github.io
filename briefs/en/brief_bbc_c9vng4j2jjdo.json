    "news_text": "Jamshid Sharmahd, an Iranian-German dissident sentenced to death for 'corruption on Earth,' reportedly died before his execution was confirmed by Iranian state media. His trial was criticized by human rights groups as unfair. Iran's judiciary claimed he died before the sentence could be carried out, while Germany condemned the act as 'cold-blooded murder' and closed its consulates in Iran. Sharmahd's family is seeking confirmation of his death from German and US authorities, expressing distrust in the Iranian government's statements. Additionally, Iran's judiciary announced death sentences for three individuals involved in the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh.",
