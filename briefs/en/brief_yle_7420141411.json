    "news_text": "The Danish military has awarded Sockmasters, a Finnish company, a significant contract for merino wool socks, amounting to at least EUR 4 million and potentially up to EUR 10.5 million. This order, which includes at least 750,000 pairs of socks, is the largest in the company's history and highlights the quality of their products. The contract was signed with the Danish Ministry of Defence and will last for four years. The socks are designed for various conditions, including Arctic environments. The success in the tender was unexpected due to the higher price of Finnish socks, but they received the best scores in both field and laboratory tests. This agreement is expected to create new jobs and open doors for future NATO contracts.",
