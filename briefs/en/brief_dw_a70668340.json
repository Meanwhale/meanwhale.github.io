    "news_text": "Over the next week, EU member state politicians will undergo public questioning in Brussels as they vie for top commissioner positions within the European Commission. Each of the 26 candidates will face three hours of scrutiny from representatives of the European Parliament's political blocs. The questioning aims to assess candidates' qualifications, financial interests, and moral views. If candidates fail to meet expectations, their home countries may need to nominate replacements. The process has seen rejections in the past, and current candidates face scrutiny due to political affiliations and scandals. The new Commission, led by Ursula von der Leyen, will focus on strengthening the EU economy and addressing various new departmental responsibilities.",
