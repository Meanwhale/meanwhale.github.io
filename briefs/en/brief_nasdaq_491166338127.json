    "news_original_title": "AMD's AI Data Center Revenue Soars but Shares Sink. Is It Time to Buy the Stock on the Dip?",
    "news_text": "AMD's Q4 earnings report showed a 69% year-over-year increase in data center revenue, reaching $3.9 billion, but it fell short of analysts' expectations. The company's overall revenue increased by 24% to $7.66 billion, with adjusted EPS rising 42% to $1.09. Despite strong growth in data center and client segments, AMD's gaming revenue dropped significantly. The company forecasts continued revenue growth in 2025, but faces challenges in competing with Nvidia in the GPU market. AMD's valuation appears attractive, but investors should consider other stocks as well.",
