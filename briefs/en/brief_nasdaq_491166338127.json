    "news_text": "AMD&#x27;s Q4 earnings report showed a 69% year-over-year increase in data center revenue, reaching $3.9 billion, but it fell short of analysts&#x27; expectations. The company&#x27;s overall revenue increased by 24% to $7.66 billion, with adjusted EPS rising 42% to $1.09. Despite strong growth in data center and client segments, AMD&#x27;s gaming revenue dropped significantly. The company forecasts continued revenue growth in 2025, but faces challenges in competing with Nvidia in the GPU market. AMD&#x27;s valuation appears attractive, but investors should consider other stocks as well.",
