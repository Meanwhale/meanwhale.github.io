    "news_text": "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has provisionally concluded that the merger between Vodafone and Three could proceed if both companies agree to price commitments for consumers and enhance the UK's 5G rollout. Initially, the CMA had concerns that the merger could harm competition and raise prices, but these concerns may be addressed with proposed remedies. Vodafone expressed optimism about the CMA's proposal, stating it could benefit businesses and consumers. The CMA's investigation began in January, and the merger would create the largest mobile network in the UK with approximately 27 million customers. The CMA is seeking feedback on its proposals by November 12, with a final decision expected by December 7.",
