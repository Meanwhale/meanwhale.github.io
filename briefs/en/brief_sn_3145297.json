    "news_text": "In South Africa, forensic entomology is aiding in the fight against rhino poaching by allowing investigators to estimate the time of death of poached rhinos using insect evidence. This method, which involves collecting insects like blowflies and beetles from the carcasses, helps establish a minimum postmortem interval, thereby assisting in tracking and convicting poachers. The technique was adapted from human forensic investigations and has shown promise in increasing rhino populations through enhanced anti-poaching efforts. Despite its effectiveness, forensic entomology is not widely utilized in wildlife crime investigations.",
