    "news_text": "Just two weeks into his second presidency, Donald Trump welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Their previous collaboration included Trump's controversial recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Following Hamas's attacks on October 7, 2023, Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza, resulting in significant Palestinian casualties. Trump proposed a plan for Gaza's reconstruction, suggesting US control and resettlement of Palestinians. His remarks raised concerns about potential violations of international humanitarian law, as he implied Palestinians could be displaced. Meanwhile, the two-state solution remains a contentious issue, with Netanyahu's administration rejecting it amid ongoing violence.",
