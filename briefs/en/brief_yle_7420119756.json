    "news_text": "A recent four-day workweek experiment in Germany, funded by the University of Munster and other organizations, demonstrated increased employee well-being, with participants reporting less stress, more sleep, and improved physical activity. Over 90% of employees noted positive impacts on their well-being. However, researchers caution that the experiment lacks scientific peer review and may not be applicable across all sectors. While 73% of participating organizations plan to continue the four-day workweek, the long-term effects on productivity remain uncertain. The study involved various companies, primarily small to medium-sized, and utilized both subjective surveys and objective physiological data to assess outcomes.",
