    "news_text": "President Joe Biden has called for immediate evacuations as Hurricane Milton approaches Florida, having intensified to a Category 5 storm with winds reaching nearly 74 meters per second. The National Hurricane Center warns of potential fluctuations in the hurricane's strength as it moves over the eastern Gulf of Mexico, but it is expected to remain dangerous and powerful when it reaches Florida on Wednesday evening. Biden emphasized the urgency of the situation, stating it could be the worst natural disaster to hit Florida in a century. Residents are urged to evacuate now, especially as Florida is still recovering from Hurricane Helene, which caused significant destruction and resulted in at least 230 fatalities.",
