    "news_text": "JP Morgan Chase is taking legal action against customers who allegedly exploited a glitch known as the 'infinite money glitch' to withdraw large sums of money from its ATMs. This involved writing large cheques to themselves, depositing them, and withdrawing funds before the cheques bounced. Lawsuits have been filed against two individuals and two businesses in Houston, Miami, and Los Angeles, seeking the return of over $660,000, along with interest, overdraft fees, and legal costs. The bank emphasizes its commitment to combating fraud and holding accountable those who engage in fraudulent activities. The loophole was reportedly closed shortly after the glitch gained attention on social media.",
