Pelicot's husband, along with 50 other men, is on trial for drugging and raping her while she was unconscious, leading to discussions about toxic masculinity and the definition of consent in French law. The case has inspired survivors like Justine, who also experienced chemical submission, to seek justice and speak out against their abusers. Activists and feminists are calling for legal reforms, including better training for police on chemical submission and amendments to the law regarding sexual abuse. The trial has ignited a movement reminiscent of the #MeToo movement, with Pelicot becoming a role model for many survivors.",
