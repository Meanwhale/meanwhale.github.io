    "news_text": "At a summit in Tanzania, leaders from east and southern Africa urged an immediate ceasefire in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) amidst escalating violence involving the M23 rebel group and Rwandan troops. Despite the presence of Rwandan President Paul Kagame and Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi, the summit&#x27;s final statement did not explicitly mention Rwanda&#x27;s involvement. The M23 has claimed control of Goma, leading to significant casualties. Calls for international intervention have been met with limited action, raising concerns about the effectiveness of global responses to the conflict. Protests in South Africa and Brussels highlight demands for sanctions against Rwanda, reflecting frustrations over perceived inaction and complicity in the ongoing crisis.",
