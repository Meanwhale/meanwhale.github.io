    "news_text": "According to CommercialEdge's U.S. office market report, office utilization has not improved despite return-to-office mandates from companies like Amazon and Meta. Many firms are reducing office space as remote and hybrid work continues to prevail. A KPMG survey indicates that while 83% of CEOs expect a return to five-day office weeks in three years, actual office occupancy remains low, with a national average of 50.2%. Vacancy rates have increased to 19.5%, and the average lease size has decreased by over 25%. Key tech markets like Austin and Seattle have seen a slowdown in new office development due to layoffs and rising costs. Overall, the office sector faces distress with 20% of office space remaining vacant.",
