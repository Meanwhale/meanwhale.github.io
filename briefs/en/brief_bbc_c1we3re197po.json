    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves revealed at the World Economic Forum that the government's plans to abolish non-dom status will be modified to provide a more generous phase-out of tax benefits for non-doms. This change aims to facilitate the repatriation of funds to the UK, addressing concerns about fairness in the tax system. Critics worry that these changes may lead to wealthy individuals leaving the UK, especially after a report indicated a significant increase in millionaires leaving the country. The government maintains that the new system will attract talent and investment while ensuring long-term residents pay their taxes. However, some financial experts and opposition parties express skepticism about the effectiveness of these changes.",
