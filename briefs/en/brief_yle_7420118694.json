    "news_text": "In Brussels, EU leaders are actively seeking new legislation to facilitate the return of migrants to the EU, emphasizing the need for effective control of the Union's external borders in compliance with EU and international law. The meeting focused on the significant influx of migrants from Russia and Belarus, with Polish Minister Donald Tusk highlighting the right to seek asylum. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, stated that Member States, including Finland and the Baltic countries, must be able to implement necessary protective measures. There is a call for EU-level legislation to address instrumental migration, and discussions are ongoing regarding the establishment of return centers in third countries for individuals without residence permits. However, many questions remain about the logistics and duration of stay in these centers.",
