    "news_text": "The three-day Brics summit in Kazan, Russia, features leaders from approximately twenty countries, including UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, as President Vladimir Putin aims to demonstrate that Russia is not financially isolated. This summit is the largest international conference held in Russia since WWII. The Brics group has expanded to include South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates, and Iran, with Saudi Arabia also recognized as a member. Notable attendees include China's President Xi Jinping and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alongside representatives from ten countries interested in joining or cooperating with Brics, particularly Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Despite Turkey's support for Ukraine, it seeks to join Brics while maintaining ties with Russia. Guterres's participation raises concerns about Russia potentially using him for propaganda, given its violations of the UN Charter.",
