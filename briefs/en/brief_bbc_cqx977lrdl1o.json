    "news_text": "US President Donald Trump has announced a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, effective March 12, prompting major trade partners like Canada, Australia, the UK, the EU, India, and South Korea to react. Canada, a significant supplier, has expressed strong opposition, while Australia may receive an exemption. The UK plans to engage in discussions with the US, and the EU has vowed to respond to the tariffs. India downplays the impact, but concerns about market flooding have been raised. South Korea is considering negotiations after previously receiving a waiver. Overall, these tariffs may lead to shifts in global trade dynamics.",
