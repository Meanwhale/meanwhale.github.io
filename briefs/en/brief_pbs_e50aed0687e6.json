    "news_text": "A planned news conference between Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and U.S. envoy Kellogg was canceled amid rising political tensions over the war in Ukraine. The U.S. requested the change, reflecting deteriorating relations between Zelenskyy and Trump, especially after Trump accused Zelenskyy of being unpopular and a dictator. This follows a recent agreement between Russia and the U.S. to discuss ending the war, which Zelenskyy criticized for excluding Ukraine. Meanwhile, European leaders voiced support for Zelenskyy, emphasizing his democratic legitimacy. Amid these diplomatic tensions, Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilians continue, with recent strikes resulting in casualties and power outages in various cities.",
