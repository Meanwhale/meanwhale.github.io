    "news_text": "In his new book 'War', journalist Bob Woodward alleges that former President Donald Trump sent COVID-19 tests to Russian President Vladimir Putin during the pandemic in 2020, amidst a global shortage of tests. Woodward describes Trump as the 'most irresponsible and impulsive president in U.S. history' and claims that Trump had multiple private phone calls with Putin, including one in early 2024 after his presidency ended. Additionally, Woodward discusses President Joe Biden's foreign policy, noting Biden's frustration with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's leadership style during the Gaza conflict, where Biden has referred to Netanyahu in derogatory terms.",
