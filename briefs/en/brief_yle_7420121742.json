    "news_text": "Jukka Parvinen, Director of Vantaa parish association, highlights that cuts to state funding and changes in fund distribution will affect large cities. Preliminary calculations suggest cemetery fees in Vantaa could rise by about 300 euros. The Ministry's budget proposal includes a 20 million euro reduction in funding for the Evangelical Lutheran Church, which supports funeral services and the maintenance of culturally significant buildings. The new funding distribution will consider population and other criteria, potentially disadvantaging larger municipalities like Helsinki and Vantaa. The proposed changes aim to align funding with the Church's social functions but raise concerns about fairness and equity.",
