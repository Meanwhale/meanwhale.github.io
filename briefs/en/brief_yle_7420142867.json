    "news_text": "Elon Musk and Sam Altman, former partners in the artificial intelligence company Open AI, have become adversaries. Musk has made a $97.4 billion bid for the non-profit segment of Open AI, which is currently led by Altman. The offer is seen as a potential valuation for the non-profit, as the board is restructuring to separate profit-making activities. Musk has criticized Open AI for straying from its charitable roots and has filed complaints against the company. Altman responded mockingly to Musk&#x27;s offer, suggesting they could buy Twitter for a fraction of the bid. Musk&#x27;s financial position may require him to sell shares in Tesla or SpaceX to fund the offer.",
