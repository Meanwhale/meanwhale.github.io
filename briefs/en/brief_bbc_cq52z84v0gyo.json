    "news_text": "According to Nationwide, home sales in the UK are predicted to 'jump' at the beginning of next year as buyers rush to purchase before the rise in stamp duty, effective from March 2025. This change will impact many first-time buyers, but its overall effect may be less significant than previous changes due to high interest rates affecting affordability. The changes will primarily affect England and Northern Ireland, with a predicted boost in activity followed by a slump. The impact will vary by region, with pricier areas like London being more affected. Current thresholds for stamp duty will revert in March 2025, and recent changes for buy-to-let landlords have already taken effect.",
