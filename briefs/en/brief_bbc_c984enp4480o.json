    "news_text": "A knife attack in Mulhouse, France, resulted in one death and five police officers injured. The attacker, a 37-year-old Algerian man, was arrested after reportedly shouting &#x27;Allahu Akbar.&#x27; The attack, which occurred near a busy market, also left a 69-year-old Portuguese man dead after he intervened. The suspect was on a terrorism watch list and had a deportation order. President Macron condemned the attack as Islamist terrorism and emphasized the government&#x27;s commitment to combating terrorism. The police were present for a demonstration supporting the Democratic Republic of Congo. Local residents expressed shock, and officials called for changes in how deportation and detention are handled, particularly regarding Algeria&#x27;s refusal to accept the suspect.",
