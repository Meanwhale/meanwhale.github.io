    "news_text": "China's economy experienced a growth rate of 5% in 2024, meeting the government's target. This growth was bolstered by robust export figures and recent economic stimulus measures. Industrial output rose by 5.8%, with exports increasing by around 7% and imports by 2.3%. However, economists warn of a potential slowdown in future growth due to an aging population and declining birth rates. Official data indicates a population decrease, with 1.408 billion people at the end of 2024, about 1.39 million fewer than the previous year.",
