    "news_text": "Donald Trump's victory in the US election was the main focus of German media, highlighting the country's own political crisis.

Despite Trump's unpopularity in Germany, some media noted that he was the candidate Americans wanted. Reactions varied, with concerns about future German-American relations and Trump's stance on Ukraine, while far-right leaders celebrated his win as a rejection of immigration and climate policies. The media's tone ranged from shock to blunt commentary.",
