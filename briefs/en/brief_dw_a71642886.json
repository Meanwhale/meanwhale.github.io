    "news_text": "However, DW&#x27;s fact-checking reveals that his claims are misleading. The Scottish government has not made private prayer illegal, and the case of a man charged for praying outside an abortion clinic involved repeated violations of a buffer zone law. Additionally, Vance&#x27;s assertion about EU officials threatening to shut down social media during civil unrest misrepresents the Digital Services Act, which outlines strict conditions for such actions.",
