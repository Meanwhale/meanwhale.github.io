    "news_original_title": "Fact check: Claims behind JD Vance&#x27;s free speech attack debunked",
    "news_text": "He misrepresented the Scottish government&#x27;s Safe Access Zones law, which does not criminalize private prayer at home, and the case of Adam Smith-Connor, who was fined for breaching a buffer zone while praying outside an abortion clinic. Vance also claimed that EU officials intend to shut down social media during civil unrest, which is misleading as the Digital Services Act allows such actions only under extreme circumstances and after due process.",
