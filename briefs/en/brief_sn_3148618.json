    "news_text": "For the first time, astronomers have directly studied the interior of an exoplanet, K2 22b, located about 800 light-years away. Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope revealed that the planet is shedding material into space, allowing scientists to analyze its chemical composition. The dust emitted does not appear to be pure iron, suggesting the presence of a mantle. Unexpectedly, the dust resembles nitric oxide and carbon dioxide, raising questions about the planet's nature. Further observations are planned to confirm these findings.",
