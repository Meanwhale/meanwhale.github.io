    "news_text": "The Pentagon is investigating the origin of several drones that flew over U.S. military bases in Virginia for 17 days in December, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. These drones operated at a height of 160 kilometers in restricted airspace over Langley Air Base and Norfolk Naval Base. The Department of Defense has not determined if the drones were operated by a hobbyist or a foreign intelligence agency. U.S. law prohibits shooting down drones unless they pose a threat. Earlier, five drones were also reported near a nuclear test facility in Nevada.",
