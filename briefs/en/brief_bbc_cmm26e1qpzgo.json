    "news_text": "From April, water bills in England and Wales will increase by an average of \u00a3123 annually, reaching \u00a3603. Some companies, like Southern Water, will see increases as high as 47%. The hikes are attributed to the need for infrastructure improvements and inflation. Households can reduce bills by using less water, checking for leaks, or applying for social tariffs. The Consumer Council for Water has expressed concerns that support for low-income households is insufficient, as many are already in debt to their water companies.",
