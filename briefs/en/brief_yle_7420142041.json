    "news_text": "Antti Ronkainen, a researcher at the University of Helsinki, believes that Europe&#x27;s dependence on the United States will continue to grow. He outlines three options for Europe in response to proposed US tariffs: imposing countertariffs, not participating in the trade war, or yielding to the US to avoid customs duties. Ronkainen notes the difficulty of reaching a consensus in Europe due to the lack of a single leader. He highlights that Europe&#x27;s dependence has increased since the onset of the war in Ukraine, and despite discussions about greater autonomy, Europe currently appears to be acting as a subordinate to the US.",
