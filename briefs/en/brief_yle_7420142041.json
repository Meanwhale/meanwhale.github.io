    "news_text": "Antti Ronkainen, a researcher at the University of Helsinki, believes that Europe&#x27;s dependence on the United States will continue to grow. He outlines three options for Europe in response to import duties proposed by US President Donald Trump: impose countertariffs on the US, avoid participating in the trade war and break its alliance with the US, or yield to US demands to avoid customs duties. Ronkainen notes that Europe lacks a unified leadership and consensus, making it difficult to respond effectively. He observes that Europe&#x27;s dependence on the US has increased since the onset of the war in Ukraine, and despite discussions about Europe becoming more self-reliant, it currently appears to act as a subordinate to the US.",
