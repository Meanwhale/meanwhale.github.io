    "news_text": "Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies in the U.S. have become politically charged, leading major corporations like Meta and Walmart to reconsider their strategies. Experts suggest this shift is not indicative of a lack of concern for DEI, but rather a response to rising lawsuits and conservative backlash. While DEI initiatives have gained traction since the Black Lives Matter movement, recent Supreme Court rulings have intensified anti-DEI sentiments. Despite some companies scaling back, a significant majority still plan to uphold or enhance their DEI efforts in the coming years, though the absence of clear goals may lead to reduced investments.",
