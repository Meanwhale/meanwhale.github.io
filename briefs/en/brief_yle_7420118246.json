    "news_text": "A study by Tel Aviv University and the Danish National Museum found that two-thirds of 450 clay cups excavated in Tel Hama were made by children, indicating that young children participated in industrial work as early as the Bronze Age, around 2000 years before the Common Era. The cups, used in daily life and royal events, were linked to the Kingdom of Ebla. Researchers used fingerprints to estimate the age and gender of the young potters, who began working in workshops around the age of 7. The findings suggest that children learned craft routines easily, similar to practices observed during the Industrial Revolution, and also engaged in creative activities by making small clay figures.",
