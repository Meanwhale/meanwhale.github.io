    "news_text": "Research conducted by the University of Tel Aviv and the Danish National Museum highlights the historical involvement of children in industrial work, dating back to the early Bronze Age in the Middle East. The study, published in 'Childhood in the Past,' analyzed 450 clay cups found in Tel Hama, where two-thirds were linked to children. These cups were used in daily life and royal events. The findings suggest that children as young as seven were engaged in cup-making, a practice that reflects similar trends seen during the Industrial Revolution in Europe and the U.S. The researchers noted that human fingerprints remain unchanged throughout life, allowing them to estimate the age and gender of the cup makers. The production of these cups was essential due to their frequent breakage during celebrations, indicating a high demand for craftsmanship among children, who were able to express their creativity through this work.",
