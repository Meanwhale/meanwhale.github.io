    "news_text": "New analyses of samples from asteroid Bennu show that it had warm salty ponds with the biochemical precursors for life, but these environments did not lead to the creation of life. The findings suggest that not all potentially habitable environments develop life, as the samples contained both left- and right-handed versions of nucleic and amino acids in equal amounts. This indicates that the conditions may not have been suitable for life to emerge.",
