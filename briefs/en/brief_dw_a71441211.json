    "news_text": "The Sahel states of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger have officially withdrawn from the regional economic bloc ECOWAS, effective immediately. This decision follows their formation of the Alliance of Sahel States and leadership by military juntas after recent coups. The countries have criticized ECOWAS for being overly influenced by France and have sought support from Russian mercenaries. The withdrawal affects approximately 73 million people and significantly reduces the geographical area of ECOWAS. Despite this, the bloc aims to keep its doors open for the three nations, allowing them some membership privileges. The departure raises concerns about ECOWAS's representation of West African interests and its ability to leverage the region's natural resources.",
