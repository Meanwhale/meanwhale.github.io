    "news_text": "Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic began, scientists continue to seek evidence regarding the virus's origins. The debate centers on whether SARS-CoV-2 leaked from a lab or evolved naturally. Researchers argue that understanding the origin is crucial for health policy and pandemic prevention. The CIA suggests a lab leak is more likely, while others support the zoonotic theory, linking the virus to wildlife at a market in Wuhan. Despite extensive studies, definitive evidence remains elusive, and experts emphasize the need for collaboration to uncover the truth, which could inform responses to future pandemics.",
