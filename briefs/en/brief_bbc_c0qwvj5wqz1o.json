    "news_text": "Italian police have launched extensive raids targeting Mafia clans in and around Palermo, involving more than 1,200 officers. The operation aims to dismantle the Mafia&#x27;s governing body, the Cupola, amidst concerns that released bosses have continued their activities using encrypted phones. Investigators found that the Cosa Nostra has modernized its operations, with leaders managing to maintain control without in-person meetings. The raids, the largest in years, come as authorities seek to curb the Mafia&#x27;s resurgence, following the arrests of notorious figures like Salvatore Riina and Matteo Messina Denaro. Police are investigating a range of crimes, including drug trafficking and attempted murder, and have arrested several previously released bosses.",
