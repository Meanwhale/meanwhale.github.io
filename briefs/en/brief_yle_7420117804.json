    "news_text": "Scientists and industry experts express skepticism about Finland's new tax credit for green investments, citing strict deadlines and conditions that may not effectively promote new projects. Critics argue that the support may only benefit projects that would have occurred anyway, with many existing projects already well-planned. The EU's tight timeline for decisions further complicates the situation, potentially limiting the impact of the tax aid. Some experts suggest that the minimum investment threshold is too high, excluding many viable projects, and call for more realistic timelines for project completion. The government aims to stimulate economic growth through these investments, but the overall effectiveness and financial implications remain uncertain.",
