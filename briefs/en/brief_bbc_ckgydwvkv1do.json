    "news_text": "A chairlift accident at the Ast\u00fan ski resort in the Spanish Pyrenees has resulted in 10 injuries, with two women in intensive care. The incident was caused by a pulley failure that led to a cable slackening, causing chairs to fall. Initial reports indicated around 30 injuries, but later updates confirmed 17 needed medical attention. Rescue services responded quickly, and the resort has been closed. Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez expressed shock at the news, and a support line has been established for affected families.",
