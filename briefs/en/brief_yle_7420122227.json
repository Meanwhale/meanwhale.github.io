    "news_text": "Mauri Upper Kotola, the former Rector of the University of Lapland, was dismissed from his position, which he found surprising. He mentioned that the House of Lords would complain about redundancy. The dismissal followed a lecture that was reportedly confused, and there were claims of excessive alcohol costs during his tenure. Kotola indicated that his dismissal might be linked to health issues and differing opinions. He served as Rector from 2006 to 2019 and returned as a media science professor afterward. Kotola plans to appeal the dismissal.",
