    "news_text": "Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is attempting to clarify the definition of 'working people' as scrutiny of his party's tax plans intensifies before the upcoming Budget. Labour previously promised not to increase taxes on working individuals but did not specify who they consider 'working people.' The government is contemplating tax increases on asset sales and freezing income tax thresholds, while Prime Minister insists that these changes will not affect working individuals. However, he has struggled to define who qualifies as a working person, leading to accusations from the Conservatives that Labour is redefining the term. The Prime Minister described working people as those who earn a living through traditional employment and expressed concern for those who may face financial difficulties. The discussion is politically significant as Labour prepares for its first Budget since 2010, with ongoing debates about tax policy and definitions of working individuals.",
