    "news_text": "Sir Keir Starmer is attempting to clarify the definition of 'working people' as Labour faces scrutiny over its tax plans ahead of the upcoming Budget. The party had previously promised not to raise taxes on working individuals but did not specify who they consider as 'working people.' The government is contemplating tax increases on asset sales, freezing income tax thresholds, and changes to inheritance tax. Prime Minister's definition of working people excludes those with additional income from assets, but his spokesman suggested that individuals with small savings could still be included. The debate over the definition has become politically significant as Labour prepares for its first Budget since 2010, amidst concerns about adhering to election promises. The government is also considering various tax changes, including capital gains tax and inheritance tax adjustments, while the exact impact on working individuals remains unclear.",
