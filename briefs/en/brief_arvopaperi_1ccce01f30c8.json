    "news_text": "On Tuesday afternoon, long-term US government debt interest rates rose as President Jerome Powell is set to address the Senate regarding the US economy. President Trump signed an order imposing 25% import duties on steel and aluminum, raising fears among investors that these tariffs could accelerate inflation and influence Powell&#x27;s interest rate policy. Ursula von der Leyen warned that unjustified tariffs on the EU would provoke strict countermeasures. The interest rate on a 10-year US loan rose to 4.531%, while the two-year loan rate increased to 4.287%. Investors are also closely watching upcoming US inflation figures, with predictions of 2.9% inflation for January. Meanwhile, the euro strengthened against other currencies.",
