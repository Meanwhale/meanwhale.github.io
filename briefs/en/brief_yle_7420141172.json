    "news_text": "Finland has a substantial trade surplus with the USA, exporting more than it imports. President Trump has claimed that Europe is not purchasing enough American products, prompting him to consider tariffs on aluminium and steel. Despite Trump&#x27;s criticisms, Finnish officials argue that the surplus is not a problem for Finland, as the country relies heavily on exports for economic growth. The US is Finland&#x27;s largest surplus country in foreign trade, with exports valued at EUR 7.0 billion and imports at EUR 3.8 billion last year. Finnish imports from the US mainly consist of oil, gas, and machinery, while American cars struggle to gain market share in Finland due to size and fuel efficiency issues. Additionally, most food imports come from other European countries rather than the US.",
