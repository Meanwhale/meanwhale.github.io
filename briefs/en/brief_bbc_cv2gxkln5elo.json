    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has indicated that her upcoming Budget will require 'difficult decisions' regarding taxes, spending, and benefits, as Labour aims to address a \u00a322bn deficit in public finances. The government is considering tax increases and spending cuts totaling \u00a340bn. While Labour has ruled out raising taxes on working individuals, potential stealth taxes may include extending frozen tax thresholds, increasing National Insurance contributions for businesses, and changes to inheritance tax and capital gains tax. Additionally, there are discussions about raising fuel duty and altering pension tax relief. These measures could generate significant revenue but may face opposition from various sectors.",
