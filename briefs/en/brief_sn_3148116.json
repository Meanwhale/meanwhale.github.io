    "news_text": "Experiments with robots designed to hula-hoop have shown that an hourglass shape is essential for maintaining the stability of the hoop against gravity. The research indicates that the robot's shape needs to provide upward force and prevent the hoop from sliding off. The findings suggest that anyone can hula-hoop effectively by adjusting their movements based on the hoop's position, and that larger hoops are easier for beginners.",
