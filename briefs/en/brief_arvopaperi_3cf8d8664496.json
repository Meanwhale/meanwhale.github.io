    "news_text": "Musti Group has announced its financial results for the last quarter of its extended financial year, which now runs for 15 months. The company&#x27;s turnover rose to EUR 122.2 million, up from EUR 115.7 million the previous year. However, adjusted EBITA fell to EUR 7.3 million from EUR 12.4 million, and earnings per share dropped to EUR 0.08 from EUR 0.17. Operating profit also decreased to EUR 4.5 million from EUR 9.4 million. Managing Director David R\u00f6nnberg described the situation as &#x27;satisfactory,&#x27; noting positive turnover growth in Sweden and Norway, while consumer confidence in Finland remained stagnant. The company has expanded its store network to 415 locations, including the acquisition of Pet City. Musti Group will not distribute dividends, focusing instead on financing investments and growth, and has abandoned its long-term financial objectives under new majority ownership.",
