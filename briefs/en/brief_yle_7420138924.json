    "news_text": "Sulo Roukka, a doctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki, studied the role of chemically activated sensations in food experiences, known as chemoseness. Her research revealed that individual differences significantly influence how people perceive flavors, such as the burning sensation from capsaicin in chili and the cooling effect of menthol in mint. The study involved over 200 participants and assessed their sensitivity to various chemical compounds. Results showed that women were generally more sensitive to capsaicin than men, and younger individuals experienced stronger sensations than older ones. The findings suggest a connection between chemosensitivity and food preferences, indicating that sensitive individuals may prefer milder flavors. Further research is needed to explore the genetic and hormonal factors influencing these differences.",
