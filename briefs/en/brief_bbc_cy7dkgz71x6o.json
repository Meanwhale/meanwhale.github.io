    "news_text": "Satellite images analyzed by BBC Verify reveal damage to several military sites in Iran following Israeli air strikes on Saturday. Key locations affected include Parchin, linked to missile production and previously associated with Iran's nuclear program, where at least four structures were significantly damaged. Khojir, known for its ballistic missile infrastructure, also sustained severe damage. Analysts suggest that these strikes will impair Iran's ability to launch significant attacks against Israeli defenses. Additional damage was reported at Shahroud and a radar installation on Shah Nakhjir mountain, as well as the Abadan Oil Refinery, which is Iran's largest. While Iranian authorities confirmed strikes in Khuzestan province, the extent of damage remains challenging to verify with satellite imagery.",
