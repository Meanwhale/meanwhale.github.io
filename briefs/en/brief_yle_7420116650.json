    "news_text": "China has announced temporary anti-dumping measures on brandy imported from the EU, particularly affecting France, as a counteraction to the EU's decision to impose higher tariffs on electric cars from China. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated that preliminary findings indicated EU brandy imports are causing significant harm to China's domestic production. Importers of brandy will face mandatory guarantee deposits, which may be refunded if China and the EU reach an agreement on trade disputes before actual increased tariffs are implemented. This move particularly impacts French cognac producers like Hennessy and Remy Martin, as China is a crucial market for them, being the largest export destination for European cognacs after the United States.",
