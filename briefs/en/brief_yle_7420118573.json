    "news_text": "President Volodymyr Zelenskyi has announced a victory plan for Ukraine, focusing on future security and NATO membership as essential for protection against Russia. Experts express doubts about the plan's feasibility, noting that Ukraine is unlikely to join NATO soon. The ongoing war complicates the situation, with Ukraine needing Western weapons and soldiers to sustain military operations. Zelenskyi's proposal includes leveraging Ukraine's natural resources for economic benefits post-war, but the destruction caused by the conflict raises concerns about the country's recovery. As Western support appears stagnant, there are fears that discussions among Western leaders may not yield concrete promises for Ukraine's future.",
