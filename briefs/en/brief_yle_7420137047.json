    "news_text": "A group of 58 international experts proposes a new approach to assessing obesity, arguing that the current BMI method can mislead and does not provide sufficient health information. They suggest incorporating body mass measurements and scans to better understand excess body fat's impact on health. Obesity is seen as a chronic disease, with over a billion people affected globally. The Finnish expert Kirsi Pietil\u00e4inen expresses concerns about the practicality of the proposed method in Finland, citing costs and complexity. She emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive assessment that includes laboratory studies and lifestyle data, rather than relying solely on BMI.",
