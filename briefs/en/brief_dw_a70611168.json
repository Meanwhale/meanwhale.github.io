    "news_text": "Polls closed in Bulgaria's seventh general election in three years, with preliminary results indicating a win for Boyko Borisov's GERB party, which received 26.08% of the votes. The reformist coalition We Continue the Change (PP) followed with 14.76%, and the ultra-nationalist Vazrazhdane party garnered around 13.8%. Exit polls suggest GERB could secure about 74 seats in the 240-seat parliament, while PP and Revival could get 42 and 36 seats, respectively. The election was called after previous groups failed to form a coalition, amidst ongoing political instability since 2020. Voter turnout was 38%. The pro-Russia Vazrazhdane party, which has gained popularity with its anti-LGBTQ legislation and calls to lift sanctions on Russia, performed weaker than expected. The We Continue the Change/Democratic Bulgaria bloc, aiming to strengthen Bulgaria's EU position, also exceeded expectations. Bulgaria, an EU member since 2007, faces challenges with reforms and corruption, impacting its access to EU recovery funds.",
