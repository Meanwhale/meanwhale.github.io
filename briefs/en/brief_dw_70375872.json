    "news_text": "Asteroid 2024 ON, discovered in July 2024, was reported as potentially hazardous due to its size and speed, but it passed Earth at a safe distance of one million kilometers. Despite media sensationalism, astronomers track many near-Earth objects (NEOs), with about 34,000 known, none of which are on a collision course with Earth. Larger asteroids like 2024 ON may strike Earth once every 10,000 years, while smaller NEOs could cause significant damage. NASA's NEOWISE mission documented over 158,000 NEOs, and its successor, the NEO Surveyor, will launch in 2027 to find more potentially hazardous asteroids. Tracking and monitoring these objects is crucial for planetary defense, as demonstrated by NASA's successful DART mission, which tested the ability to redirect an asteroid.",
