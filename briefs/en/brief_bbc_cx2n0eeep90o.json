    "news_text": "Rachel Reeves' Budget has been described as 'very, very different' from the previous mini-Budget by Liz Truss, according to Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones. His comments were intended to reassure markets following a rise in government borrowing costs and a drop in the pound. The government is implementing new rules to ensure that public service spending is funded by tax receipts rather than borrowing. The yield on government bonds has increased, indicating higher borrowing costs, which could impact mortgage rates. Despite initial market reactions, the changes are not as severe as those following the previous mini-Budget. Reeves announced significant spending increases funded by tax hikes and borrowing, while the IMF and the Office for Budget Responsibility have endorsed the Budget.",
