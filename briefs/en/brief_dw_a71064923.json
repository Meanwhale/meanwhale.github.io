    "news_text": "Volkswagen, while historically seen as a German brand, has a vast global presence and relies on various countries for production. Recent shifts in the automotive market, particularly towards electric vehicles, have impacted VW's sales, especially in Europe and China, where demand is decreasing. The company reported a decline in sales and operating profit in 2024, leading to significant job cuts in Germany. VW's extensive production network includes facilities in several countries, but it faces challenges from rising energy costs, competition, and potential tariffs in the US. Despite some growth in South America, especially Brazil, the overall market conditions are tough, and VW must adapt to maintain its position in the global market.",
