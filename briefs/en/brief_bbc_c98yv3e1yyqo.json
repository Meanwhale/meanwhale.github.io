    "news_original_title": "Trump says tariffs coming on steel and aluminium",
    "news_text": "President Donald Trump announced a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminum entering the US, which will primarily impact Canada. He also mentioned potential reciprocal tariffs on countries that tax US imports, though specifics were not provided. This move escalates Trump&#x27;s trade policy, which has already led to retaliation from China. Canadian officials expressed concern over the economic risks, highlighting the interconnectedness of US and Canadian economies. The EU and Australia are also reacting to the potential tariffs. Trump&#x27;s tariffs are seen as a means to protect US jobs and boost the economy, but they have raised concerns about a trade war.",
