    "news_text": "A recent E. coli food poisoning outbreak connected to McDonald's Quarter Pounder hamburgers has led to one death and at least 49 reported infections across 10 western states, primarily in Colorado and Nebraska. The CDC confirmed that the contaminated hamburgers are responsible for the illnesses, with ten individuals hospitalized, including a child with severe kidney issues. Investigations suggest that slivered onions may be the source of the outbreak. In response, McDonald's has suspended the distribution of these onions and temporarily removed the Quarter Pounder from the menu in affected areas. The company's stock price fell over 6% following the news.",
