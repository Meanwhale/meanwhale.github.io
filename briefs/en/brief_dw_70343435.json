    "news_text": "The LUNA Analog Facility, created by the German Space Agency (DLR) and the European Space Agency (ESA), aims to replicate the moon's environment on Earth. Opened in late September 2024, it features 700 square meters of artificial regolith made from volcanic soils and rocks. Astronauts Matthias Maurer and Thomas Pesquet demonstrated sample collection in a simulated lunar landscape, although the facility lacks a gravity simulation, making it feel less authentic. Engineers are working on a 'gravity offload system' to mimic lunar gravity. The facility, developed over 12 years, will aid in astronaut training and technology testing, contributing to Europe's goal of lunar exploration by the 2030s.",
