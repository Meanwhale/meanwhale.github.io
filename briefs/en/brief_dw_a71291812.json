    "news_text": "Amid increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR), especially in low-and-middle income countries, there is an urgent need for new antibiotics. Indian pharmaceutical companies like Wockhardt are testing new antibiotics against resistant pathogens. The development of antibiotics is more complex and time-consuming than vaccines, as antibiotics target multiple bacteria with various resistance mechanisms. Localized approaches are being adopted to address specific community needs, with a focus on infections like neonatal sepsis and hospital superbugs. However, the global approval process poses challenges, requiring simultaneous studies for local and global priorities. Collaboration with regional teams is essential to combat AMR effectively.",
