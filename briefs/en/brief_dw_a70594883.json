    "news_text": "Following a deadly E. coli outbreak linked to fresh onions at McDonald's, several fast-food chains, including Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, KFC, and Burger King, have proactively removed onions from their menus. McDonald's has stopped serving its popular Quarter Pounder in 20% of its restaurants after one death and at least 49 illnesses were reported across 10 states. A lawsuit has been filed against McDonald's by a man who tested positive for E. coli after consuming a Quarter Pounder. The onions were supplied by a California-based company, which has not yet responded. Restaurant Brands International, owner of Burger King, confirmed that 5% of its locations used the same onions, but reported no illnesses or contact from health authorities.",
