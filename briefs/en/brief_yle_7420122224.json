    "news_text": "Pharmaceutical companies are legally obligated to report availability disturbances of medications to the Finnish Medicines Agency (Fimea). However, many companies fail to report these disturbances, causing doctors to prescribe medications that are not available, leading to unnecessary pharmacy visits and delays in treatment. In recent months, hundreds of unreported availability disturbances have been documented, raising concerns about patient care. The situation is exacerbated by the small size of the Finnish market, which makes it less attractive for pharmaceutical companies. Solutions are being proposed to improve reporting and management of availability issues.",
