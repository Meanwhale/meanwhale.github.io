    "news_text": "Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica is losing ice rapidly, contributing to rising sea levels. Researchers are proposing ambitious engineering projects to stabilize the glacier and slow down sea-level rise. These plans include creating massive underwater barriers to block warm ocean currents and pumping water from beneath the glacier to freeze it to the bedrock. However, these proposals are controversial, facing opposition from some scientists who argue it could distract from addressing climate change at its source. The feasibility of these projects, both scientifically and logistically, remains uncertain.",
