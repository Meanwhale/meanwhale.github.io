    "news_text": "In a national address, South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa asserted that the country would not be bullied, highlighting the challenges posed by rising nationalism and protectionism. He did not directly mention the US or President Trump, who has criticized South Africa's government over land expropriation laws. Ramaphosa's comments come amid deteriorating diplomatic relations with the US, particularly after Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he would skip the upcoming G20 summit due to concerns over South Africa's policies. The South African government, facing accusations of land confiscation, maintains that its new land reform law is akin to eminent domain laws used in the US.",
