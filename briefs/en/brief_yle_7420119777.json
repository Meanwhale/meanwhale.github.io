    "news_text": "The OSCE stated that the elections and referendum in Moldova were well-organized and that citizens' fundamental rights were generally respected, allowing candidates to campaign freely. However, Russian officials, including spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, alleged that the elections were dishonest, claiming that the opposition faced significant pressure and persecution, although no evidence was provided. Peskov also questioned the legitimacy of the reported support for EU membership. The elections included a referendum on recognizing EU accession as a national goal, which was reportedly subject to pressure from Russia. Allegations surfaced regarding Russia's involvement in vote-buying, with claims of financial incentives offered to voters. Despite these accusations, Russia denied any interference in Moldova's electoral process.",
