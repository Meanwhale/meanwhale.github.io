    "news_text": "Researchers have developed bioinspired flaps for aircraft wings that mimic the covert feathers of birds, which could enhance flight performance. These flaps, which deploy passively at high angles of attack, improve lift by up to 45% and reduce drag by 31%. They also help mitigate stall and increase flight stability, making them beneficial for maneuvers in gusty conditions and short runway landings.",
