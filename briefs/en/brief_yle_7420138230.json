    "news_header": "Four of the six visible planets can be seen with the naked eye, with Mars being particularly bright this January.",
    "news_text": "Currently, six planets of the solar system are visible in the night sky, with four of them (Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) easily seen without a telescope. Mars is notably bright and reddish, while Saturn appears darker. The phenomenon, informally called a 'planet parade', is not rare and occurs every two to three years. The planets are not in a straight line but form an arc across the sky. The moon will join the group on February 1st. The claims that this event occurs once in 396 billion years are false, as the solar system is only 4.5 billion years old.",
