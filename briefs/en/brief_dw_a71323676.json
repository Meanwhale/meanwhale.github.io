    "news_text": "US President Donald Trump has announced plans to implement 10-20% tariffs on all imports to encourage domestic manufacturing and reduce the trade deficit. Critics argue that these tariffs could lead to higher prices for consumers, particularly affecting low-income individuals. Trump has specifically targeted China for tariffs, threatening 20-60% on Chinese imports as he aims to bring more manufacturing back to the US. In response, China has announced provisional tariffs on US industrial plastics. Trump also criticized the USMCA trade deal and threatened tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, while pushing for increased production from European automakers in the US.",
