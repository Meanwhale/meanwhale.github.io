    "news_text": "At the University of Oulu, two professors argue that the governance crisis could be resolved if the entire Board of Directors resigned. Following the announcement of a new Rector, three out of four board members announced their resignation. Professors Petri Lehenkari and Jukka Kekkonen emphasize the importance of the college as a decision-making body and suggest that it should investigate the reasons behind the board members' resignations. They believe the college has the authority to express distrust in the board's activities and potentially dismiss the entire board. Current board chairman Mikko Ayub is uncertain about the dismissal process, while Helka-Liisa Hentil\u00e4 notes that the college can propose the release of a board member under certain conditions. The current rector has not commented on the professors' proposal.",
