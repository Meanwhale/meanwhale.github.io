Investigators reported that up to 1,400 people were killed, mostly by security forces, during a brutal crackdown on opposition protests. The findings suggest that the government was aware of and involved in serious human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings and torture. The report was based on interviews with survivors and other evidence, and it highlights a coordinated strategy by the former government to suppress dissent.",
