    "news_text": "The State Trade Research Centre argues that taxation is a superior financing option for development than development aid. It highlights the importance of strengthening tax collection in African countries to combat issues like the grey economy and corruption. Taxation fosters political responsibility, as it requires accountability from leaders to their citizens, unlike aid, which can be mismanaged. In Nigeria, for instance, the reliance on oil revenue distances the elite from the populace, as they are not dependent on tax income.",
