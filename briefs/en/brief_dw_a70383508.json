    "news_text": "The strike by approximately 45,000 port workers in the US could lead to significant disruptions in global trade, particularly affecting the import and export of goods, including German vehicles. New York Governor Kathy Hochul has urged consumers not to stockpile food as important produce may spoil at ports. The strike, which affects 36 ports from Maine to Texas, is driven by demands for a pay raise and job security amidst automation concerns. While German automakers have sufficient inventory to withstand a short strike, prolonged disruptions could impact production and sales, especially as the US is a key market for German exports. President Biden has the authority to intervene but has not yet indicated plans to do so, despite the potential political implications ahead of the elections.",
