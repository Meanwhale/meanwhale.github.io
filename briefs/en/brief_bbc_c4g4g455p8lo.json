    "news_text": "Scientists have discovered that a massive meteorite, S2, which struck Earth three billion years ago, was 40-60 km wide and caused a tsunami larger than any in recorded history, boiling the oceans and creating a 500 km crater. Despite the devastation, research led by Prof. Nadja Drabon from Harvard University indicates that such impacts may have actually helped early life thrive by churning up essential nutrients like phosphorus and iron. The findings suggest that after these catastrophic events, life was resilient and quickly rebounded, benefiting from the conditions created by the impacts. The research highlights a new perspective on the relationship between asteroid impacts and the development of early life on Earth.",
