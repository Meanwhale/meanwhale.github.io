    "news_text": "Scientists discovered that a meteorite, 200 times larger than the one that caused the dinosaur extinction, struck Earth three billion years ago, creating a massive tsunami and boiling the oceans. The impact site in South Africa revealed that despite the destruction, early life thrived due to the nutrients churned up by the impact. The research indicates that such catastrophic events may have actually facilitated the growth of simple organisms by providing essential nutrients like phosphorus and iron. The findings suggest that early life was resilient and benefited from the violent impacts, which acted like a giant fertilizer for the planet.",
