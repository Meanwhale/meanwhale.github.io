    "news_text": "Scientists discovered that a huge meteorite, 200 times larger than the one that killed the dinosaurs, struck Earth three billion years ago, creating a 500km crater and causing a global tsunami. This event boiled the oceans and darkened the skies, devastating simple life forms. However, the impact also churned up nutrients like phosphorus and iron, which allowed early microorganisms to thrive. The research suggests that rather than solely causing destruction, such massive impacts may have provided favorable conditions for life to flourish. The findings were published in the journal PNAS.",
