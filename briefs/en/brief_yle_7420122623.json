    "news_text": "Experts indicate that Donald Trump has attracted new voters and is currently showing strong prospects in the presidential race. The New York Times reports a shift towards Trump, although final results may vary. Professors Markku Swedenla and Mikko Saikku suggest that Trump is now more equipped for the presidency compared to 2016, having gained experience and developed a political program over the past eight years. His support is rooted in value and economic conservatism, appealing particularly to small towns and rural Americans. Despite some opposition within the Republican Party, Trump's position remains robust.",
