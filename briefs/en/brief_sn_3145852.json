    "news_text": "A study has revealed that the StCDF1 gene in potatoes not only regulates tuber formation but also limits nitrogen uptake. Genetically modified potatoes with a silenced StCDF1 gene performed better in low-nitrogen conditions compared to control plants. This discovery could pave the way for developing potato varieties that need less fertilizer, thus saving costs for farmers and reducing environmental impact. The research highlights the potential for improving nitrogen efficiency in potatoes, a staple food worldwide.",
