    "news_text": "On October 30, Chancellor Rachel Reeves will deliver Labour's first Budget in 14 years, which is expected to include challenging financial decisions, potentially raising taxes and implementing spending cuts amounting to \u00a340bn. The Budget statement will outline plans for taxation and public spending, following the last Budget by Conservative Chancellor Jeremy Hunt before the general election. Reeves has emphasized that there will be 'no return to austerity' and aims to fund day-to-day spending through raised taxes rather than increased borrowing. Speculations about the Budget include possible increases in National Insurance contributions for employers, changes to income tax and National Insurance thresholds, adjustments to inheritance and capital gains taxes, pension taxation reforms, and potential increases in the National Minimum Wage. The Budget will be broadcast live, and the Conservative leader Rishi Sunak will respond immediately after. The Treasury will publish a report detailing the measures, and the Office for Budget Responsibility will assess the economic impact.",
