    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to deliver Labour's first Budget in 14 years on October 30, which may include difficult decisions such as tax increases and spending cuts amounting to \u00a340bn. The Budget will outline the government's financial plans, including potential changes to National Insurance contributions, income tax thresholds, inheritance tax, capital gains tax, pension taxation, stamp duty, non-dom tax status, fuel duty, winter fuel payments, and VAT on private schools. The Budget speech will be broadcast live, and the Conservative Party leader Rishi Sunak will respond immediately after. Labour has pledged not to raise taxes on working people but is considering various measures to address financial challenges inherited from the previous government.",
