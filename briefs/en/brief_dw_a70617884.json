    "news_text": "In a recent election, Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lost 65 seats, reducing its total to 191, far below the 233 needed for a majority. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, facing a backlash from voters over a corruption scandal involving LDP politicians, acknowledged the party's defeat as a 'severe judgement.' The main opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP), gained 50 seats, but no party achieved a clear majority. Ishiba vowed to implement reforms to combat corruption, although forming a coalition appears challenging due to the fragmented opposition. The election also saw the rise of smaller parties with populist and extremist views, reflecting voter frustration with mainstream politics.",
