    "news_original_title": "Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Celsius (CELH): Should You Buy?",
    "news_text": "Investors often rely on Wall Street analysts&#x27; recommendations before making stock decisions. Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) has an average brokerage recommendation of 1.67, indicating a Strong Buy. However, studies show that brokerage recommendations may not effectively guide investors, often due to analysts&#x27; biases stemming from their firms&#x27; vested interests. The Zacks Rank, based on earnings estimate revisions, is a more reliable indicator of stock performance. Currently, Celsius has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) due to declining earnings estimates, suggesting caution despite the positive brokerage outlook.",
