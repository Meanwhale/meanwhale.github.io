    "news_original_title": "Odesa: Decolonization debate on the Black Sea",
    "news_text": "Italian Street in Odesa, Ukraine, has been renamed as part of a decolonization process following the war with Russia. Originally named in 1824, it was renamed Pushkinskaya in 1880 but reverted to its original name in 2023. The law mandates the removal of imperial symbols, including monuments and street names associated with the Russian Empire and Soviet Union. Over 400 street names and 19 monuments in Odesa are affected. While some support the changes, others argue it threatens Odesa&#x27;s cultural heritage. Critics believe the focus should be on honoring local Ukrainian figures rather than removing historical references. The ongoing debate highlights the complexities of cultural identity in a war-torn context.",
