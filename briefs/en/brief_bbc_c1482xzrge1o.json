    "news_text": "NASA has successfully launched the Europa Clipper spacecraft from Cape Canaveral, Florida, after a delay due to hurricane Milton. The spacecraft will embark on a 1.8 billion-mile journey to Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, which may harbor a vast ocean beneath its icy surface. Scientists believe that discovering life on Europa could indicate that life is common in the solar system. The mission, years in the making, will involve mapping Europa's surface and analyzing its potential for habitability. The spacecraft is designed to withstand high radiation levels and will utilize gravitational assists from Earth and Mars to reach its destination by 2030. An international team of scientists will oversee the mission, emphasizing the importance of exploration and understanding our universe.",
