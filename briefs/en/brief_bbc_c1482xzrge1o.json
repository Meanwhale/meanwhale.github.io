    "news_text": "NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft successfully launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, after a delay due to hurricane Milton. The mission will travel 1.8 billion miles to reach Europa, a moon of Jupiter, by 2030. Scientists believe that beneath Europa's icy surface lies a vast ocean that could harbor life. The spacecraft will conduct detailed mapping and analysis of the moon's surface and potential water plumes. Despite the challenges posed by radiation, the mission aims to explore the moon's habitability by investigating the presence of liquid water, heat sources, and organic materials. The launch represents a significant step in space exploration, emphasizing curiosity and knowledge rather than profit.",
