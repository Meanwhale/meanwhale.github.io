    "news_text": "Research by Clever Real Estate reveals that 86% of agents believe recent commission structure changes, following a DOJ lawsuit against NAR, will drive agents out of the industry. Sellers are no longer required to pay the buyer's agent's commission, leading to pessimism among agents about their career prospects, with 48% feeling less optimistic. While 64% oppose the changes, support among homeowners is notable, with 67% backing the settlement despite a lack of understanding of its details. The majority of homeowners and buyers want agents to disclose commission rates upfront, and many homeowners are now more inclined to sell due to reduced commission obligations. Agents are planning to adapt their business strategies in response to these changes.",
