    "news_text": "Research by Clever Real Estate reveals that 86% of agents believe recent commission structure changes, resulting from a DOJ lawsuit against the National Association of Realtors, will drive agents out of the industry. The changes mean sellers are no longer required to pay the buyer's agent's commission, shifting this responsibility to buyers. Nearly half of the agents surveyed feel pessimistic about their career prospects, and 72% predict a negative impact on the industry. While 67% of homeowners support the changes, many lack a strong understanding of the lawsuit. A majority of homeowners and buyers want agents to disclose commission rates upfront and support government regulation of these rates. Additionally, 83% of agents plan to adapt their business strategies in response to these changes.",
