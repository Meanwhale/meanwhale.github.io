    "news_text": "Finding and combating Islamic State militants in northeastern Somalia is challenging. Following an airstrike ordered by President Trump, he declared on social media that the U.S. would find and eliminate these militants. The strike targeted a senior IS planner and was claimed to have caused no civilian harm. Puntland, a semi-autonomous region, has been independently fighting IS for years and has captured numerous IS outposts. While IS has become a growing concern, especially under its leader Abdulqadir Mumin, Puntland's forces remain self-reliant. Experts warn that IS-Somalia is expanding its influence and capabilities, posing a threat beyond Africa. The U.S. military's involvement remains uncertain, with the effectiveness of airstrikes questioned.",
