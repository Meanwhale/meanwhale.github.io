    "news_text": "Research indicates that the extinction of many kangaroo species in Australia around 40,000 years ago may have been more influenced by human hunting than climate change. Dental analysis of 937 kangaroo teeth shows they had diverse diets, contrary to previous beliefs of restricted eating habits. This adaptability likely helped them survive climatic shifts, pointing to human hunters as the main factor in their decline.",
