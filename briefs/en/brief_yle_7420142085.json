    "news_text": "Boat sales have steadily decreased since their peak in 2020 and 2021, with new registrations dropping nearly 20% last year. Despite this, the boating sector is expected to recover, as indicated by a study showing increased popularity. While some companies have faced challenges, particularly those focused on Nordic markets, others, like Saxdor, have managed to grow. The overall sentiment in the industry is cautiously optimistic, with many companies expecting turnover growth this year.",
