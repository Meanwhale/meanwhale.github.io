    "news_text": "Illegal border crossings to the EU decreased by 38% last year, according to Frontex. This is the lowest level since 2021, with around 239,000 crossings registered. The decrease was largely due to a 59% drop in the Middle Mediterranean and a 78% drop in the Western Balkans. The share of women in the cross-border population remained stable at just over 10%.",
