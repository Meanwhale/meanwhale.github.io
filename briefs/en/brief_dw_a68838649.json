    "news_text": "Donald Trump\u2019s election victory occurred over two months ago, but he will not assume the presidency until January 20. This delay stems from a historical quirk in the US Constitution, which originally set Inauguration Day in March. The 20th amendment, ratified in 1933, moved the date to January 20 to prevent prolonged periods of leadership vacuums. The election process in the US is unique, with each state managing its own voting rules, leading to a complex certification process. The period between election and inauguration is often referred to as the 'lame-duck' period, where the outgoing president can still enact policies. Joe Biden has used this time to issue pardons and implement final actions.",
