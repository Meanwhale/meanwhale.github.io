    "news_text": "The 2024 US presidential election will occur on November 5, with the winner being inaugurated on January 20, 2025. This 11-week gap was established to prevent chaos and instability in government, a change made in 1933 during the Great Depression. The election process is complex and decentralized, involving state-level certification of votes and the Electoral College system, where voters choose electors rather than directly voting for a president. The timeline from election to inauguration has historical roots, reflecting logistical considerations of travel in the early years of the US.",
