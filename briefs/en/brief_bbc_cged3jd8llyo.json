    "news_text": "In September, a significant landslide in Dickson Fjord, Greenland, caused a 200m wave that generated seismic signals detected globally for nine days. The landslide, linked to climate change, involved the collapse of 25 million cubic meters of rock and glacial ice. Researchers, including an international team and the Danish Navy, investigated the event, revealing that the wave was trapped in the fjord due to its complex structure, allowing it to oscillate instead of dissipating. This phenomenon underscores the increasing frequency of such landslides in the Arctic, driven by rising temperatures and melting glaciers.",
