    "news_text": "Last September, a landslide in Dickson Fjord, Greenland, caused a seismic signal that lasted for nine days, detected globally. The landslide involved 25 million cubic meters of rock collapsing and creating a 200m wave that was trapped in the fjord, leading to continuous vibrations. Scientists linked the event to climate change, as melting glaciers destabilize the mountains. This unprecedented phenomenon underscores the increasing frequency of such landslides in the Arctic, prompting calls for further research on their implications.",
