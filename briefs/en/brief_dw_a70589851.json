    "news_text": "A study published in Nature on October 23 highlights the importance of Tugunbulak and Tashbulak, two ancient cities in Uzbekistan, as major urban centers on the medieval Silk Road. Using drone-based LiDAR technology, researchers discovered large settlements with fortifications and plazas, suggesting these high-altitude cities played a crucial role in trade and cultural exchange between East and West. The cities, located over 2,100 meters above sea level, were likely hubs for industrial activities and resource trading. The findings challenge the perception of mountainous regions as barriers to trade, indicating their significance in the economic landscape of Central Asia during the early medieval period.",
