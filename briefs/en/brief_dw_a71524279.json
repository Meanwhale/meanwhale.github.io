    "news_text": "In Kenya, a silent war is unfolding in the digital realm as the government intensifies its crackdown on AI-generated content and social media activism. This has led to a series of abductions targeting government critics, including notable figures like cartoonist Gideon Kibet and Billy Mwangi. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights reported 82 abductions since June 2024, with many still missing. As AI-generated protests and political satire proliferate online, the government struggles to control the narrative, leading to increased tensions. Kenyan officials are considering stricter regulations for social media platforms, while the country continues to be a leader in digital innovation. The situation reflects a broader trend in Africa, where governments are grappling with the challenges posed by digital dissent.",
