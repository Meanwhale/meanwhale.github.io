    "news_text": "Recent findings provide a more accurate and diverse understanding of Finnish citizens in Russia and the Soviet Union during the 1920s. Many Finns, who fled to the Soviet Union after the 1918 Civil War, sought better lives but faced persecution under Stalin. The National Archives have added 6,000 new entries to their database, including details about Red refugees and former Finnish Parliament members. This new information helps uncover the identities and experiences of these individuals, revealing a more comprehensive picture of their lives and the challenges they faced.",
