    "news_text": "The German government has lowered its economic growth forecast for 2025 to 0.3%, down from 1.1% projected last October. This revision comes as the country faces political instability following the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition government last November, which disrupted growth measures. Economy Minister Robert Habeck stated that Germany is in stagnation, and the forecast downgrade is also attributed to increased trade risks with the return of US President Donald Trump. A recent survey found that 53% of respondents expect their financial situation to remain stable over the next year.",
