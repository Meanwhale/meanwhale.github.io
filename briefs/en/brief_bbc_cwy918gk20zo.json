    "news_text": "Eug\u00e8ne Rwamucyo, a former doctor from Rwanda, has been sentenced to 27 years in prison by a French court for his involvement in the 1994 genocide. He was found guilty of complicity in genocide and crimes against humanity, although he was acquitted of direct charges of genocide. Rwamucyo denied any wrongdoing and plans to appeal. His trial is the eighth in France related to the genocide, which resulted in the deaths of approximately 800,000 people, primarily Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Despite no evidence of him personally committing violence, prosecutors argued he spread anti-Tutsi propaganda and helped conceal evidence of the genocide. Rwamucyo was previously sentenced to life in absentia in Rwanda.",
