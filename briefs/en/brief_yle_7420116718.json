    "news_text": "U.S. President Joe Biden was scheduled to travel to Germany on Thursday but has postponed his state visits to Germany and Angola due to Hurricane Milton threatening Florida. Biden was set to attend a meeting of the Ramstein group coordinating material aid for Ukraine on Saturday. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated that the intensifying Hurricane Milton requires the president to remain in the U.S. to monitor the situation. The White House has not disclosed how long the trip will be delayed or if Biden will be able to attend the Ramstein meeting. Hurricane Milton is expected to hit the Tampa Bay area of Florida on Wednesday and could be the strongest storm in the Gulf of Mexico since 2005, according to The New York Times.",
