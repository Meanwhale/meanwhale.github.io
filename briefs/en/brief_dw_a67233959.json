    "news_header": "Tropical storm seasons are worsening, with recent hurricanes causing significant damage in Florida and raising concerns about climate change's impact on storm intensity.",
    "news_text": "The tropical storm season is becoming increasingly severe, highlighted by two major hurricanes hitting Florida within a month, including Hurricane Milton, which struck as a Category 3 storm, causing extensive damage and power outages. The National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings due to heavy rainfall. Scientists warn that climate change is exacerbating the strength of these storms, as rising ocean temperatures allow hurricanes to absorb more water vapor, increasing their intensity. The conditions necessary for hurricane formation include warm sea surface temperatures and low-pressure areas. As ocean temperatures rise, the likelihood of weak hurricanes developing into stronger ones has increased, complicating meteorological predictions.",
