Hamid, a university student, had plans for an internship in New York but was forced to escape Khartoum when fighting erupted between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF. He left with his young daughter, facing numerous dangers along the way. Ahmed, who worked for the UN, also fled with his family from Darfur to Chad, seeking safety.
