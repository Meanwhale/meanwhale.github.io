    "news_text": "Recent guidelines from pension companies indicate a shift in responsible investment policies, now permitting investments in the arms and nuclear industries. Previously, responsible investments were limited to avoiding sectors like tobacco and alcohol. Companies like Ilmarinen and Varma have adjusted their policies to include defense-related investments, with Ilmarinen allowing investments in NATO-related nuclear activities. The debate around responsible investing has evolved, especially following geopolitical events like Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Critics argue that major European investors should reconsider their stance on the defense industry, which is seen as a crucial area for economic growth and security. The Nordic Investment Bank has also indicated a willingness to finance defense projects, reflecting a broader trend towards increased defense spending.",
