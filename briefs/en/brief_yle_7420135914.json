    "news_text": "Recent guidelines from pension companies indicate that investing in the arms and nuclear industries is now considered suitable for responsible investors. Historically, responsible investments were limited to avoiding sectors like tobacco and alcohol. However, with changes in geopolitical circumstances, particularly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Finland's NATO membership, attitudes towards the arms industry have shifted. Companies like Ilmarinen and Varma are now allowing investments in defense-related sectors, including nuclear weapons, under certain conditions. This reflects a broader acceptance of the defense industry as a viable investment option, driven by increasing defense budgets and a changing economic landscape.",
