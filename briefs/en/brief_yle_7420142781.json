    "news_text": "Supercell, a game company known for its popular titles, reported a record turnover of EUR 2.8 billion from six games, with an operating margin of approximately EUR 880 million. The company&#x27;s net sales rose by 77% and profits by 78%. Managing Director Ilkka Paananen noted that despite the stagnation in the mobile gaming market, all six of their games grew, marking a significant achievement. The success is attributed to better game quality and strategic marketing, including partnerships with brands like Disney-Pixar. Supercell&#x27;s leading game, Brawl Stars, was the fastest-growing game globally last year. The company spent EUR 500 million on marketing, which is considered unique in Finland. However, despite increased revenue, Supercell&#x27;s corporate tax payments to Finland decreased due to changes in reporting policies. The company also released a new game, which saw significant downloads but did not meet expectations. Overall, the mobile gaming market is facing challenges, with a 6% drop in downloads last year, but spending on applications increased by 4%.",
