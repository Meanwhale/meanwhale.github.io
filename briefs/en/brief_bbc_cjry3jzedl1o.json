    "news_original_title": "Body returned from Gaza is not Shiri Bibas, Israeli military says",
    "news_text": "Israel has accused Hamas of breaching the ceasefire agreement after forensic tests showed that the body returned from Gaza was not Shiri Bibas. The IDF confirmed that the other three bodies were identified as her sons, Ariel and Kfir, and peace activist Oded Lifshitz. Prime Minister Netanyahu claimed Hamas placed a Gazan woman&#x27;s body in Shiri&#x27;s coffin, demanding her return alongside other hostages. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum expressed devastation over Shiri&#x27;s absence. The ceasefire deal, effective since January 19, included the exchange of hostages and bodies, with ongoing negotiations for the release of remaining hostages. Meanwhile, violence continues, with recent bombings in Bat Yam linked to suspected terrorism, prompting intensified military operations in the West Bank.",
