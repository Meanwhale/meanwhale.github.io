    "news_text": "The South Korean court decided to extend the arrest of President Yoon Suk-yeol, who is facing impeachment charges, due to concerns he could destroy evidence. Yoon was arrested in his office after being barricaded there for weeks. The court's decision allows him to be held for two weeks, following an initial 48-hour limit. His impeachment is linked to a controversial emergency declaration from December, which led to political turmoil. If convicted of mutiny, Yoon could face life imprisonment. Protests erupted outside the courthouse, leading to clashes with police and the arrest of several demonstrators.",
