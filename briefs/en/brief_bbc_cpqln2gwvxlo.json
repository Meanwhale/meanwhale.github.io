    "news_text": "The Bank of Japan has increased its short-term policy rate to around 0.5% following a significant rise in consumer prices in December, marking the highest borrowing costs in 17 years. This decision comes after the fastest price increase in 16 months was reported. The BOJ aims to avoid market shocks and has signaled further rate hikes to stabilize the economy. Core consumer prices rose by 3% year-on-year in December. The bank's strategy indicates a gradual increase towards around 1%, allowing for future rate cuts if necessary. Analysts expect continued rate hikes as wages and inflation rise.",
