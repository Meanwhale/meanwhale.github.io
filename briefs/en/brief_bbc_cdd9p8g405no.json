    "news_text": "Judge Carl Nichols issued a temporary restraining order preventing President Trump from placing 2,200 workers at USAID on paid leave, following a lawsuit from two unions. The order will last until February 14. Separately, another judge blocked Elon Musk&#x27;s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing Treasury records containing personal financial data of Americans. Trump aims to dismantle USAID, arguing it misuses taxpayer money, while unions claim the actions violate the Constitution and harm workers. The ruling reinstates previously placed staff on leave and prohibits further administrative leave until the specified date.",
