    "news_text": "Recent data from the European Copernicus climate service indicates that 2024 has become the first year to exceed the symbolic 1.5C warming threshold, marking it as the hottest year on record. While this does not mean the long-term average target has been breached, it brings the world closer to that point due to ongoing fossil fuel emissions. UN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described the situation as 'climate breakdown' and emphasized the urgent need for countries to reduce emissions. The last decade has seen the highest temperatures recorded, primarily driven by human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. The trajectory suggests that the world could surpass the 1.5C long-term warming threshold by the early 2030s, with significant climate impacts expected. Despite uncertainties, scientists stress that reducing emissions can still mitigate the worst effects of climate change.",
