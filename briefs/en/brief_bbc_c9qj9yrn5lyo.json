    "news_text": "Senamile Masango, South Africa&#x27;s first black female nuclear scientist, has passed away at the age of 37. Known as &#x27;the queen of science&#x27;, she was a source of inspiration for many young women. Despite facing discrimination as a black woman in her field, she earned respect for her determination and achievements, including being part of an African-led team at CERN. Masango was dedicated to promoting science education among women and disadvantaged communities. Born in 1987 in KwaZulu-Natal, she overcame personal challenges to complete her education and establish a foundation to encourage girls in science. Her contributions were recognized with several awards, but she also faced significant challenges due to her race and gender.",
