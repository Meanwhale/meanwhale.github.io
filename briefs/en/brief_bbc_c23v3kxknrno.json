    "news_text": "Samuel Weidenhofer, who struggled with mental health issues after losing his aunt to suicide, bullying, and a speech impediment, began spreading positivity through social media at age 17. He gained 1.7 million followers on Instagram by sharing acts of kindness, such as surprising people with gifts. Other kindness influencers, like Zachery Dereniowski, also create content that highlights generosity but face criticism for potentially performative acts. Experts note that while these videos attract millions of views, they can raise ethical concerns about consent and the portrayal of vulnerable individuals. Despite this, influencers argue that their approach helps raise funds and awareness for those in need.",
