    "news_text": "Samuel Weidenhofer struggled with mental health issues after a family tragedy and bullying. At 17, he began using social media to spread positivity through acts of kindness, gaining a large following. Other kindness influencers have emerged, sharing similar content that often involves surprising strangers with gifts. While these videos attract millions of views and promote positivity, they also face criticism for being performative and potentially exploitative. Critics argue that the focus on vulnerable individuals can be troubling, and there are concerns about the management of large sums of money given to those in need.
