    "news_text": "Khaled Massoud and his family spent seven days and $1,300 fleeing Israeli bombings in Lebanon to reach a refugee camp in northern Syria. They are among at least 220,000 people who have crossed into Syria, with many facing extortion at multiple security checkpoints controlled by various forces. Human rights organizations warn that returning Syrians risk detention or worse under the Assad regime. The journey is fraught with danger and costs, with reports of fees ranging from $300 to $600. Many displaced Syrians, living in poverty in Lebanon, find themselves viewed as targets for exploitation. Despite the hardships, some manage to return to their homes, grateful to escape Lebanon's dire conditions.",
