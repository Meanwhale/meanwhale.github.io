    "news_text": "The construction sector is likely to experience mixed earnings in Q4 2024, driven by increased infrastructure spending and strong housing demand, but hindered by rising labor costs and supply chain disruptions. While some companies may report strong results, others could face margin pressures. Federal spending and reshoring initiatives support growth, particularly in industrial construction. However, challenges like labor shortages and material costs persist. Overall, earnings are expected to decline by 5% compared to the previous year, with revenues projected to increase slightly. Five construction stocks are highlighted as potential outperformers this earnings season.",
