    "news_text": "According to ATTOM Data's U.S. Home Affordability Report for Q3 2024, single-family homes and condos are less affordable in 99% of counties compared to historical averages. Homeownership costs now consume 33.5% of the average national wage, slightly improved from the previous quarter but still above the preferred 28% threshold. The national median home price reached $365,000, with mortgage rates above 6%. While some counties saw wage growth outpace price increases, 78% of counties require more than 28% of wages for homeownership. The report highlights a mixed market, with rising prices and taxes limiting affordability, yet declining mortgage rates offering some relief. Overall, homeownership remains historically unaffordable, but there are signs of gradual improvement.",
