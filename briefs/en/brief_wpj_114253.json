    "news_text": "According to ATTOM Data's U.S. Home Affordability Report for Q3 2024, single-family homes and condos are less affordable in 99% of counties compared to historical averages. Homeownership costs now consume 33.5% of the average national wage, above the preferred 28% benchmark. Although there has been a slight improvement due to declining mortgage rates, the national median home price is $365,000, and ownership costs remain high. The report shows that 575 of 578 counties analyzed are less affordable, with major counties like Los Angeles and Chicago leading the unaffordability list. While some areas have seen wages grow faster than home prices, 71% of counties still experience price increases outpacing wage growth. Overall, homeownership remains a financial challenge, although there are signs of improvement in certain markets.",
