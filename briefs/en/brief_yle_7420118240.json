Myanmar's military junta has intensified censorship, while China's internet remains heavily restricted. Improvements in internet freedom are noted in some countries, particularly Zam.",
    "news_text": "According to Freedom House, internet freedom has been deteriorating for the past fourteen years, with Myanmar and China identified as the weakest countries. Myanmar's situation has worsened, making it the weakest for the first time in a decade, as a military junta has suppressed dissent and jailed thousands for online activities. New technologies have been introduced to block VPNs, which help bypass internet restrictions. In China, the internet remains heavily controlled by the Great Firewall, limiting access to social media and news. While many countries have seen improvements, Kyrgyzstan has experienced significant declines, including the closure of the Cloop website, which reported on human rights abuses. The report highlights that the most improvements in internet freedom were seen in Zam, while Finland, Norway, and Sweden were not included in the comparison.",
