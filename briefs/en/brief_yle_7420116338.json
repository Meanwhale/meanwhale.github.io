    "news_text": "There is still a significant number of small apartments for sale, preventing their prices from rising quickly. Real estate professionals surveyed in Kiinteist\u00f6maailma's biannual barometer are more optimistic than six months ago, expecting an increase in transaction volumes across all housing types. However, the oversupply of small apartments means no immediate price increases are anticipated. Conversely, about half of the agents believe there is upward pressure on prices for newer single-family homes. The survey included 227 professionals from around 50 locations, and they expect increased activity in family homes, larger row houses, and newly built single-family homes in the coming six months. While small apartment sales prospects are not very promising, there is a continuous shortage of newer single-family homes, indicating potential price increases. The traditional mantra in real estate has been 'location, location, location,' but the latest responses suggest that 'price, price, and then location' may be more relevant, as buyers are aware of the lower price levels compared to two years ago. Properly set asking prices lead to quicker sales and better final sale prices. The condition of the property is also highlighted as a significant factor in sales success, with well-maintained homes attracting a larger buyer pool.",
