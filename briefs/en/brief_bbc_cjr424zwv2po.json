    "news_text": "Following a disputed election, Georgia's pro-Western president, Salome Zourabichvili, has urged the international community to support the Georgian people, asserting that the election results were 'totally falsified.' Despite the ruling Georgian Dream party claiming a fair election, Zourabichvili, aligned with the opposition, called for peaceful protests and suggested potential actions like international reviews or new elections. The EU, NATO, and the US have demanded investigations into allegations of vote fraud. Tensions are high as the government prepares for further protests, having acquired new riot control equipment. Zourabichvili accused the government of employing a sophisticated propaganda strategy influenced by Russia, while the government denies any Russian involvement. Some international leaders have congratulated the ruling party, causing discontent among European partners.",
