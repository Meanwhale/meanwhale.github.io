    "news_text": "Hurricane Milton, currently a Category 5 storm with wind speeds of about 75 meters per second, is moving away from Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula towards Florida's west coast. Meteorologists have noted its rapid intensification from a tropical depression to a major hurricane in just three days, which is linked to climate change and the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The storm poses a significant threat due to storm surges, with a predicted rise of 4.5 meters that could inundate homes. Florida is experiencing its largest evacuation in history, affecting approximately 5.5 million people. The entire central Florida region, which contributes 2.8% to the U.S. GDP, is under threat from the hurricane.",
