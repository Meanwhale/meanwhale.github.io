    "news_text": "Markku Karjalainen, known as 'Mr. Treehouse', has been involved in wooden house construction for 30 years but faces setbacks as many wooden construction companies go bankrupt. In Tampere, a project intended for wooden homes has shifted to concrete due to the lack of suitable Finnish entrepreneurs and financial issues. The trend of replacing wood with concrete is evident across Finland, with several large wooden housing projects stalled. Despite the increasing share of wooden houses in construction, the industry is threatened by bankruptcies and a lack of suitable building models. Karjalainen believes that upcoming regulations on environmental impacts may revive interest in wooden construction. Kirsi Koski, CEO of the Tampere Student Housing Foundation, highlights the benefits of wooden buildings, including lower CO2 emissions, and expresses hope for the future of wooden housing.",
