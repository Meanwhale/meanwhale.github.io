    "news_text": "Markku Karjalainen, known as 'Mr. Treehouse', has been advocating for wooden houses for 30 years, but the industry is struggling due to bankruptcies among wood builders and a shift to concrete construction. In Tampere, a project intended for wooden homes has been converted to concrete due to the lack of suitable Finnish entrepreneurs and the failure of previous wooden construction companies. The overall situation for wooden construction in Finland is dire, with many projects stalled and a perception that wooden houses are more expensive and complex to build. Despite government support and a growing interest in low-carbon solutions, wooden construction has not gained significant traction compared to neighboring Sweden. However, there is hope that upcoming regulations on environmental impacts will revive interest in wooden buildings, as they have lower CO2 emissions compared to concrete. Kirsi Koski, CEO of the Tampere Student Housing Foundation, highlights the successful completion of wooden apartments, indicating a potential shift towards more sustainable building practices.",
