    "news_text": "The Brazilian Supreme Court announced on Tuesday that it would lift the ban on Elon Musk's social media platform X, which had been blocked in Brazil for over a month due to a dispute regarding misinformation. Judge Alexandre de Moraes stated that he would allow the immediate restoration of the platform's operations after X paid millions in fines for failing to comply with previous court orders. The tensions between de Moraes and Musk escalated when Musk refused to shut down accounts spreading false news and hate speech related to Brazil's 2022 election campaign. The situation intensified in August when de Moraes dramatically blocked X for not removing accounts linked to former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro. Musk accused de Moraes of censorship and compared him to Voldemort from Harry Potter. Ultimately, Musk agreed to all of de Moraes' demands to have the ban lifted. Last week, it was confirmed that X had paid approximately $5.2 million in fines imposed by the Supreme Court. Before the ban, there were about 22 million users of X in Brazil.",
