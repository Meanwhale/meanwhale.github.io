    "news_text": "A significant change in the Finnish electricity market will soon occur, where both consumption and production will be measured every 15 minutes instead of hourly, and electricity prices will also fluctuate every quarter hour. This change may reduce savings for solar energy producers unless they can better time their electricity consumption to match solar production. Research indicates that while the immediate impact on savings may seem concerning, it is minimal over the long term. The most significant factor affecting savings will be how well producers can time their consumption, with larger solar systems yielding better savings. Additionally, the shift to quarter-hour pricing may introduce more price volatility, making timing consumption even more crucial. Overall, while there may be negative impacts on savings, the profitability of solar investments is expected to remain intact, and the use of batteries alongside solar energy may become more viable.",
