    "news_text": "Researchers have found a fossilized tadpole of Notobatrachus degiustoi in Patagonia, dating back 161 million years, pushing back the record for the earliest known tadpoles by 30 million years. The well-preserved fossil shows that tadpoles had already developed filter-feeding traits similar to modern species. This discovery indicates that the evolutionary strategy of filter-feeding in tadpoles has been stable for a long time. The fossil tadpole was significantly larger than many modern tadpoles, measuring about 16 centimeters.",
