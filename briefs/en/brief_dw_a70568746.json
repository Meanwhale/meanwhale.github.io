    "news_text": "Current polls suggest a historically close race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, with Harris leading by about 2%. Despite this, Trump's proximity to Harris in national polls is notable, as past elections have shown that polls often misrepresent voter intent, particularly among Trump supporters. Pollsters aim to accurately sample likely voters through various methods, but challenges remain in capturing certain demographics. The Electoral College system complicates predictions, with analysts focusing on key battleground states, especially Pennsylvania, which is seen as crucial for both candidates' paths to victory.",
