    "news_text": "Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro faces five charges for attempting a coup after losing the 2022 election. He allegedly plotted to poison his successor, Lula, and attack a Supreme Court Justice. Bolsonaro denies wrongdoing, claiming political persecution. The Supreme Court will consider the prosecutor&#x27;s advice on formal charges. Bolsonaro is banned from office for eight years due to false claims about election fraud. His supporters stormed government buildings in January 2023, leading to mass arrests. The trial could impact the upcoming presidential election.",
