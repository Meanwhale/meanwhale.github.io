    "news_text": "Local officials reported that Russian missiles hit a civilian container ship in Ukraine's Odesa region, killing seven people and wounding several others. This attack is part of a series of strikes targeting port infrastructure, with the region's governor noting it as the third incident in four days. The attacks coincide with President Zelensky's European tour, where he is meeting with various leaders. In addition to the Odesa strike, other attacks have occurred in Zaporizhzhia and against military targets in southern Russia. Ukraine's government claims these assaults aim to disrupt grain exports critical for international food security. Over 20 civilian ships have been damaged since the war began in 2022, prompting Ukraine to appeal for support in ensuring safe navigation and food security.",
