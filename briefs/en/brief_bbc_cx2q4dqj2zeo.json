    "news_text": "A US judge, Loren AliKhan, issued a temporary halt to President Trump's directive to freeze federal grants and loans, which was set to take effect shortly. The pause was in response to a lawsuit from organizations representing grant recipients, claiming the freeze violated the law. The White House's intention was to review funding in line with the new administration's agenda, but it caused confusion and concern among those reliant on federal funding. The judge's stay will last until a hearing next Monday, while opposition figures expressed alarm over the potential impacts of the freeze on essential programs.",
