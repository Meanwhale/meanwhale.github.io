    "news_text": "The author, Ilmari K\u00e4ihk\u00f6, reflects on the lessons learned from the Afghanistan war, warning that a similar fate may await Ukraine if current support strategies do not adapt to reality. Despite strong international backing for Ukraine, the support is wavering, echoing the moral justifications seen in Afghanistan.

He stresses the importance of recognizing the realities of the situation in Ukraine and forming a strategy that aligns with achievable outcomes, rather than relying on wishful thinking. The author calls for a commitment to prevent a repeat of past mistakes and highlights the stronger self-interests at stake in Ukraine compared to Afghanistan.",
