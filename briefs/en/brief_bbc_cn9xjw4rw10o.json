    "news_text": "Richard Hughes, chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), stated that the Treasury should have disclosed a \u00a39.5bn overspend before the previous government's Budget, suggesting they may have broken the law. This overspend was central to claims that the Conservatives left Labour with a \u00a322bn deficit. The OBR criticized the last government for not providing complete information, leading to questions about the accuracy of public finance assessments. Hughes emphasized that such failures would not recur due to new processes. The upcoming increase in National Insurance contributions is expected to disproportionately impact workers, raising further debates about Labour's tax policies.",
