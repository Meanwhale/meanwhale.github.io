    "news_text": "The UK's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), stated that the Treasury should have disclosed a \u00a39.5bn overspend prior to the previous government's Spring Budget, suggesting potential legal violations. OBR chair Richard Hughes emphasized that the Treasury failed to provide crucial information, leading to a significant gap in public finances. The Treasury defended its actions, claiming compliance with the law and promising to prevent future oversights. The OBR also highlighted that upcoming National Insurance increases would predominantly impact workers rather than employers, raising concerns about wage stagnation.",
