    "news_text": "Residents of picturesque villages in the Cotswolds are divided over plans for a massive solar park that would cover 2,000 acres of farmland, generating energy for 115,000 homes. Local campaigners, led by Rosie Clark, argue it will devastate the area and its tourism, while supporters, including former mayor Lesley Bennett, advocate for clean energy and criticize the opposition as elitist. The developers, Island Green Power, aim to address concerns and have proposed changes to reduce the visual impact of the solar panels. The public consultation is open until March 2025, after which a planning application will be submitted for government approval.",
