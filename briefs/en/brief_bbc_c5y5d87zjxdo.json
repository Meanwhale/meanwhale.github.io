    "news_text": "In a speech ahead of the Budget announcement, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer acknowledged the need to confront fiscal realities, stating that while tax increases are necessary, better days lie ahead. He announced a replacement of the \u00a32 bus fare cap with a \u00a33 cap and allocated \u00a3240 million to help people return to work. Despite Labour's previous manifesto promise not to raise taxes on working people, the Budget is expected to include tax hikes, particularly in National Insurance rates for employers. Critics argue that these tax increases will ultimately burden workers. Starmer defended the government's approach, insisting on the need for 'tough decisions' and transparency about the trade-offs involved. He faced accusations from Conservatives and others about breaking promises, while also emphasizing the importance of protecting public services from austerity.",
