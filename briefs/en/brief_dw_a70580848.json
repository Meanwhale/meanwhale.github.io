    "news_text": "Andrei, a 30-year-old political refugee and artist from Minsk, is seeking asylum in Bulgaria alongside his husband Alex, a journalist critical of Putin. They married in Denmark, as same-sex marriages are not recognized in their home countries, which have increasingly repressive laws against LGBTQ+ individuals. After receiving threats in Russia, they applied for asylum in Bulgaria, but only Alex was granted it. Andrei's application was denied due to claims of contradictory statements and lack of perceived risk. Their lawyer argues that Andrei faces risks as Alex's spouse. Despite feeling safer in Bulgaria, recent laws restricting LGBTQ+ rights have raised concerns for their safety. They plan to resubmit their asylum application and take their case to the European Court of Human Rights.",
