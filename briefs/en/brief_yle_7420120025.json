    "news_text": "Ilmari Reunam\u00e4ki discusses how Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, talks more about Donald Trump than about herself, possibly as a strategy against him. Trump is gaining momentum in the polls and media, with predictions of his winning chances exceeding 50%. Despite Harris's warnings about Trump, he continues to dominate media attention with his campaign events and social media presence. Harris's campaign lacks the same visibility, and she struggles to present a distinct platform separate from Biden's. As Election Day approaches, Trump's ability to engage and entertain the public may overshadow Harris's efforts to communicate her message.",
