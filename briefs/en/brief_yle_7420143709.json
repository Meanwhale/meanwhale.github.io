    "news_text": "The MOEX index rose nearly 10% after their phone call, despite the stock exchange&#x27;s previous decline due to strong Western sanctions. Analysts suggest that market players believe some sanctions may be lifted, which could benefit the Russian economy. However, the stock exchange remains down approximately 25-40% compared to pre-war levels, indicating the ongoing impact of sanctions and the exit of foreign investors. The recent increases reflect investor expectations rather than the actual state of the Russian economy.",
