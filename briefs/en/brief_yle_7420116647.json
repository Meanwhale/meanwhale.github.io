    "news_text": "Hungary holds the key to the EU's contribution to a \u20ac45 billion international aid package for Ukraine, as Finance Minister Riikka Purra states that Hungary continues to obstruct changes to the sanctions legislation on frozen Russian central bank assets. While 26 member states are ready to proceed with the changes, Hungary's resistance is impacting the U.S.'s commitment to the aid package. The EU aims to finance Ukraine using the proceeds from these frozen assets, ensuring that the loan costs do not burden Ukraine's public finances. The U.S. is willing to contribute \u20ac20 billion contingent on the EU revising its sanctions regulations, which currently require a review every six months instead of extending it to three years. Hungary's actions could lead to a larger EU contribution if it blocks the legislative changes. Other countries like Japan, Canada, and the UK have expressed willingness to participate in the loan mechanism. Hungary appears to be waiting for the U.S. presidential elections before making decisions, while other nations consider the matter urgent.",
