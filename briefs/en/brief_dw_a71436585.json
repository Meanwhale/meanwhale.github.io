    "news_original_title": "Trump tariffs: What do they mean for Mexico and Canada?",
    "news_text": "In a move fulfilling a campaign promise, President Trump has imposed broad tariffs on major trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, and China, citing an &#x27;extraordinary threat&#x27; from illegal immigration and drugs. Canadian and Mexican exports to the U.S. will face a 25% tariff, while energy resources from Canada will incur a 10% levy. China will see an additional 10% tariff on goods already facing duties. Economists warn that these tariffs could raise prices for American consumers and disrupt trade relations, particularly affecting Mexico, which is heavily reliant on the U.S. market. The tariffs may lead to significant economic consequences for North America, with potential GDP drops for both Canada and Mexico.",
