    "news_text": "The water industry in England and Wales is functioning poorly despite providing basic services like flushing toilets and tap water. In 2022, privatised water firms released raw sewage for 3.6 million hours, more than double the previous year. Communities are facing water shortages, and some have been advised to boil tap water. The government has initiated a major review of the sector, led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, to address systemic issues, including excessive debt and poor regulation. Critics argue that privatisation has failed, with significant dividends paid to shareholders at the expense of infrastructure investment. The review will explore options for reform, including the potential abolition of the regulator Ofwat. With rising debt and infrastructure challenges exacerbated by population growth and climate change, future water bills are expected to increase significantly.",
