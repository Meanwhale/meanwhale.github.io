    "news_text": "The water industry in England and Wales is functioning in terms of basic service delivery, but it is plagued by severe issues such as the release of raw sewage for 3.6 million hours last year and communities facing water shortages. The sector is under scrutiny due to high levels of debt, with companies like Thames Water and Southern Water struggling financially. Critics argue that privatisation has failed, leading to excessive dividends paid to shareholders instead of necessary infrastructure investment. A new independent commission will review the sector, exploring options for reform, including the potential abolition of the regulator Ofwat. The situation is exacerbated by increased demand and climate impacts, leading to calls for significant investment to address the failing infrastructure, which may result in higher bills for consumers.",
