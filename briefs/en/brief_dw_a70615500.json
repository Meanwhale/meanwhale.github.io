    "news_text": "In the upcoming presidential elections in Uruguay, leftist candidate Yamandu Orsi from the Frente Amplio alliance is projected to lead with 43.9% of the vote, while center-right candidate Alvaro Delgado has 26.7%. With no candidate achieving over 50%, a runoff is expected on November 24. Orsi, supported by former President Jose Mujica, aims to end five years of conservative rule, while Delgado's supporters emphasize their commitment to maintaining the current government. Key issues in the election include crime, particularly related to drug trafficking, and a recent proposal for police night raids that failed to pass. Uruguay is recognized for its progressive policies and high per-capita income.",
