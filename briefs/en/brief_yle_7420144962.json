    "news_text": "A recent Europe-wide report emphasizes the necessity of enhancing carbon sinks to achieve the EU&#x27;s emission targets. The European Council on Climate Change highlights the importance of sinks in Finland&#x27;s carbon sinks debate, advocating for binding targets to stimulate investment and technological advancement. Urgent measures are needed to halt the decline of soil carbon sinks and ensure sustainable biomass use. The report suggests new pricing tools for landowners to incentivize carbon capture and proposes extended emission liability for existing emitters to help achieve net negative emissions. The Council recommends legally binding targets for emission reductions and improved planning for CO2 transport and storage infrastructure. Established in 2021, the European Council on Climate Change provides scientific guidance and assessments to support the EU&#x27;s climate objectives.",
