    "news_text": "A pig in Oregon has been confirmed to have H5N1 bird flu, marking the first instance of this strain infecting a pig in the U.S. The infection, found on a farm with other quarantined animals, raises alarms due to pigs' role as mixing vessels for influenza viruses, which can lead to genetic mutations that may pose risks to humans. Experts are monitoring the situation closely as the virus continues to spread among wild birds and mammals, and while the current threat to humans remains theoretical, the potential for a larger outbreak is concerning.",
