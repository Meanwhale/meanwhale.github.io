    "news_header": "Most consumers do not choose plant protein products due to their high prices, while grocery stores attract customers with low-priced meat.",
    "news_text": "A significant portion of consumers does not include plant protein products in their shopping carts, primarily due to high prices. Grocery stores often sell ground meat at nearly zero profit margins to draw customers in for regular-priced items. Research indicates that while consumers are aware of plant proteins, their purchasing behavior is influenced more by price, taste, and health benefits than by ethical or environmental considerations. The pricing strategies of grocery stores favor meat over plant-based alternatives, with higher profit margins on meat-like plant products. Additionally, agricultural subsidies do not fully explain the high prices of plant proteins, as producers of both meat and plant proteins receive substantial support. The plant protein market faces challenges in scaling production to reduce prices and increase demand.",
