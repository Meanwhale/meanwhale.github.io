    "news_text": "On Wednesday, the Sebinas Chat introduced an AI chat box designed to assist young people's mental health. The AI, trained by mental health professionals, provides support when human assistance is unavailable. During a test conversation, the bot offered advice on fatigue and sleep issues, suggesting routines and calming activities. Although the bot was empathetic and provided familiar advice, it often tried to change the subject, which left the user feeling unheard. The chat box encourages users to seek additional support if needed.",
