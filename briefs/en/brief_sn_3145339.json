    "news_text": "The giant salmon carp (Aaptosyax grypus), a critically endangered species, has been rediscovered in Cambodia's Mekong River after not being seen since 2005. Scientists confirmed the existence of three individuals caught between 2020 and 2023, reigniting hope for the species' survival. The rediscovery suggests the carp may be more widespread than previously thought, prompting Cambodia to add it to its list of protected species. However, the future of the species remains uncertain due to threats like habitat disruption from dams, overfishing, and climate change. Researchers emphasize that this discovery is crucial not only for the carp but also for protecting the biodiversity of the Mekong ecosystem.",
