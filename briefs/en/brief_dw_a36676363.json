    "news_text": "The Ring of Fire is a horseshoe-shaped area in the Pacific Ocean with over 450 active and dormant volcanoes, where about 90% of the world's earthquakes occur. It poses a constant threat to countries like Indonesia, Japan, and the Philippines. The tectonic plates in this region move continuously, causing earthquakes and volcanic activity through processes like subduction. Major earthquakes have occurred here, including the 1960 Chile earthquake, the largest recorded. While predicting earthquakes remains difficult, awareness and preparedness are crucial for those living in the region.",
