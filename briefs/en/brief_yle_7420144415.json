    "news_text": "The upcoming elections in Germany are pivotal for both European politics and the economy. Germany&#x27;s economic decline affects its trading partners, including Finland. The country faces deep economic challenges, largely due to past energy policies and structural issues. The new government will need to address these problems while navigating global uncertainties. The elections also highlight concerns over the German debt brake and its implications for investment. A stable government could enhance Germany&#x27;s role in the EU, with potential reforms anticipated by Finnish businesses. The outcome of the elections will significantly influence economic relations across Europe.",
