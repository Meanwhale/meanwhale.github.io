    "news_text": "The German economy has been in crisis for two years, struggling with stagnant growth, high energy costs, and structural issues. Key factors include declining demand from China, which has historically been a vital market for German industries. Exports to China fell by 9% in 2023, prompting major companies like Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz to implement restructuring and job cuts. China's recent monetary stimulus aims to stabilize its economy, but experts warn it may not significantly boost German exports due to ongoing competitive and policy challenges. Despite increased German investments in China, the long-term outlook for exports remains uncertain.",
