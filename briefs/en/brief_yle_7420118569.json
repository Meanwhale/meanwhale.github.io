    "news_text": "Veera Hatakka's doctoral dissertation, examined at the University of Helsinki, investigates how color words are expressed and understood in Finnish. The research highlights that people's opinions on color names can be passionate and varied, with discussions often reflecting deeper meanings beyond mere color identification. Hatakka notes that colors are described differently based on context and that many color expressions are metaphorical. The study also emphasizes the richness of the word 'grey,' which can signify mood, age, and other abstract concepts. Additionally, the dissertation touches on how terms like 'dark' and 'light' are used in contexts where precise color identification is not crucial. Overall, Hatakka's work sheds light on the complex relationship between language, perception, and color.",
