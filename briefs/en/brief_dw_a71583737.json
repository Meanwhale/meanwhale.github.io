    "news_header": "The meeting between Jordan&#x27;s King Abdullah II and US President Donald Trump was a delicate balancing act. Abdullah proposed taking in 2,000 sick Palestinian children from Gaza, a gesture appreciated by Trump. Despite previous threats to cut aid, Trump reaffirmed US support for Jordan. The situation is complicated by Jordan&#x27;s historical reluctance to accept more Palestinians, as it already hosts over 2 million refugees. The ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Gaza, coupled with Trump&#x27;s controversial proposals for resettlement, add to the tension. Observers note that the forced displacement of Palestinians could undermine Jordan&#x27;s stability and the two-state solution. The meeting coincided with a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, with ongoing concerns about hostages and humanitarian conditions in Gaza.",
