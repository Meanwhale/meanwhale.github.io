    "news_text": "The UK is experiencing a significant health crisis, with health-related benefits for working-age individuals rising dramatically from \u00a336bn before the pandemic to a projected \u00a363bn in four years. This increase is attributed to a younger demographic suffering from mental health issues, raising fears of a permanent detachment from the labor market, especially among Gen Z. The government is under pressure to address these challenges, with proposals for reforming the benefit system and job centers to better support those affected. There are concerns about the impact of AI on entry-level jobs and the need for businesses to adapt to this new employment reality. The government aims to increase the employment rate while managing the rising costs of health-related claims, indicating a complex interplay between health, employment, and economic stability.",
