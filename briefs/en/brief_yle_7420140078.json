    "news_text": "The Panamanian people are outraged by President Donald Trump's demands to return the Panama Canal to the United States, which has led to a bitter dispute and strained relations. Residents of Para\u00edso, a town along the canal, reflect on their history with the U.S. and express their determination to defend their sovereignty. Despite Trump's claims that Panama unfairly charges American ships, experts argue that the canal has operated effectively since the U.S. withdrawal in 1999. Protests have erupted in Panama against Trump's statements, with citizens asserting their national pride and the importance of the canal to their economy.",
