    "news_text": "Hurricane Rafael caused a nationwide blackout in Cuba, with winds reaching 185 km/h. The national energy company reported that strong winds led to the electricity system shutdown. Approximately 70,000 people were evacuated before the storm made landfall in Artemisa. This incident follows a previous blackout that left millions without power for four days. Rafael weakened to a category two hurricane after moving into the Gulf of Mexico, but heavy rains and storm surges are expected to continue affecting western Cuba and the Cayman Islands.",
