    "news_text": "Banks are offering housing loans that often exceed the recommendations set by the Financial Supervisory Authority, leading to potential financial strain on borrowers. Many applicants, like Taija Rautiainen, have received offers significantly higher than what they can realistically afford, prompting them to reconsider their financial situations. The banks assert that they evaluate each applicant's ability to repay loans based on various factors, but there are concerns that their assessments may not account for personal circumstances such as family plans or job security. Ultimately, some borrowers are opting for smaller loans that align better with their financial realities.",
