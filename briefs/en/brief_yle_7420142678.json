    "news_text": "Finnish households held EUR 46.5 billion in listed shares at the end of last year, but the value increased only slightly due to a zero return on domestic shares, primarily because of the weak performance of the Helsinki Stock Exchange. While households received nearly EUR 2 billion in dividends, the value of shares fell by a similar amount. In contrast, foreign equity investments yielded an 18% return, despite making up only 15% of the equity portfolio. Households invested EUR 1.6 billion more in Finnish investment funds, with a significant increase in fund holdings overall. The average interest rate on deposits declined throughout the year.",
