    "news_text": "The municipal sector in Finland is introducing a new, uniform remuneration system that will impact 120,000 local government employees, including early childhood education teachers. The Chief Trustee of Early Education assures that wages will not decrease amidst concerns. The reform, which is part of a larger collective agreement, will categorize salaries into three levels based on skills and responsibilities, allowing for potential salary increases through training. The new system aims to reduce bureaucratic complexity and improve transparency in comparing jobs and wages across municipalities. The funding for this reform comes from a salary development program initiated in 2022, and existing pay components will remain unchanged.",
