    "news_text": "In the wake of Donald Trump&#x27;s return to the White House, several US allies have succumbed to his coercive trade tactics, promising measures to address issues like illegal migration and drug trafficking in exchange for a temporary reprieve from tariffs. While Mexico and Canada have pledged to enhance border security, Colombia reversed its stance on accepting deported migrants, and Panama made concessions regarding the Panama Canal. Economists express concern that Trump&#x27;s tariff strategy may create economic instability, increase inflation, and disrupt supply chains. Countries like India, South Korea, and Japan are adjusting their trade policies in response, while the EU considers retaliatory measures. The long-term effectiveness of Trump&#x27;s approach remains uncertain, as nations may seek alternative trade partnerships.",
