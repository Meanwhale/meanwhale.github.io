    "news_text": "Barely two weeks after Donald Trump returned to the White House, several US allies, including Mexico and Canada, have conceded to his coercive trade strategy to avoid tariffs. Mexico and Canada promised to enhance border security to combat illegal migration and drug trafficking, receiving a temporary reprieve from Trump&#x27;s proposed 25% tariffs. Colombia reversed its stance on accepting deported migrants, while Panama made concessions regarding the Panama Canal. Trump&#x27;s announcement of additional tariffs on aluminum and steel has raised concerns among allies and economists about the potential economic impact, including increased prices for US consumers and disruptions in supply chains. The long-term effectiveness of Trump&#x27;s strategy is questioned, with some suggesting that countries may develop resistance to US coercion. As uncertainty grows, countries are exploring alternative trade markets, and the EU is considering retaliatory measures.",
