    "news_text": "In a recent column, Professor Heikki Hiilamo from the National Institute for Health and Welfare criticized the Finnish Ministry for its approach to debt mitigation, suggesting that it is overly cautious due to fears of EU deficit procedures. He noted that changes in debt calculation methods have artificially inflated Finland's public debt to 80% of GDP. Juha Majanen from the Ministry defended their stance, stating their goal is to accurately represent the economy. Markus Lahtinen from the Pellervo Economic Forum agreed with Hiilamo's criticism, suggesting that the Ministry's tactics misrepresent the severity of the debt problem. Ilkka Kiema, a research director, supported the Ministry's assessments but acknowledged the challenges of economic adjustments. Lahtinen emphasized the need for transparency regarding temporary expenditures related to Ukraine and the importance of discussing Finland's debt situation openly. Overall, the debt issue is complex but manageable, with the EDP debt reaching EUR 219 billion, increasing by EUR 15.6 billion annually.",
