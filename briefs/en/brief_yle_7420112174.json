    "news_text": "Tapio Schneider, a climate scientist with Finnish, German, and American nationalities, emphasizes the unknown effects of reducing air pollution on Earth's temperature. He notes that while cleaner air is beneficial, it could lead to increased temperatures due to the loss of pollution particles that reflect sunlight. Schneider, who has lived in California for over two decades, has observed significant climate changes, including rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. He leads a team at Caltech developing a global climate model to improve predictions of climate change impacts. Schneider believes that the signs of climate change are already evident in Finland, with noticeable changes in winter conditions.",
