    "news_text": "The Federation of Commerce forecasts a growth in retail sales this year, predicting an increase of about half a percent for this year and 1-1.5 percent for next year. Although the sales volume in retail trade is expected to decline in the early part of the year, sales in department stores, hypermarkets, low-cost shops, and grocery stores have started to grow, while special stores continue to decline. The Trade Union Federation anticipates a decrease in employment in the sector by around 4,000 jobs, or just under 3%, by 2026 compared to last year. The Union notes that declining inflation and falling interest rates are improving purchasing power, but weak employment and slow economic growth are dampening consumer spending.",
