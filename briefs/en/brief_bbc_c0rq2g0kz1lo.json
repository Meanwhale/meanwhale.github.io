Despite paying \u00a31,100 a month and reporting the issue to the landlord, the mould has spread, leading to Aziyah&#x27;s asthma diagnosis. The situation is part of a larger problem in England, where over half a million rented homes have mould issues. The government is working on new legislation to protect tenants, but many complaints go unaddressed, leaving families like Sinead&#x27;s trapped in unsafe living conditions.",
