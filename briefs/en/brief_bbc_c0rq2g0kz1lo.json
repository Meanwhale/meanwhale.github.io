Despite complaints to the landlord and local authorities, the situation remains unresolved, highlighting a broader issue of unsafe living conditions in rented homes across England.",

    "news_text": "Sinead fears for her son Aziyah&#x27;s health due to persistent mould in their Brighton flat, which has worsened since they moved in 2020. Despite paying \u00a31,100 a month and reporting the issue to their landlord, the mould has spread, leading to Aziyah&#x27;s asthma diagnosis. The problem reflects a larger crisis in England, where over half a million rented homes have mould issues. Many local authorities fail to enforce housing standards, leaving tenants like Sinead and an elderly couple in Rotherham trapped in unhealthy living conditions. New laws to protect tenants from unsafe housing are yet to be fully implemented, despite tragic cases linking mould exposure to severe health consequences.",
