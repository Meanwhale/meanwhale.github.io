    "news_text": "The text explores the ancient practice of using victimhood to justify violence, illustrating this through historical and modern examples. It discusses how figures like Heinrich Himmler rationalized genocide by framing their actions as necessary for the survival of their people. The narrative extends to contemporary issues, such as the psychological trauma of Israeli soldiers and the manipulation of victim identity in modern democracies, where groups may perceive themselves as victims to justify oppressive actions against others. The text warns of the dangers of adopting a victim mentality that disregards the suffering of others and promotes violence as a means of self-defense.",
