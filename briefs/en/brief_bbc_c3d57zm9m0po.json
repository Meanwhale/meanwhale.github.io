    "news_header": "US inflation rose to 3% in January, exceeding expectations due to higher egg and energy prices. This marks the highest rate in six months and poses challenges for President Trump, who focused on inflation during his campaign. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates unchanged amid uncertainty about the economy. Grocery prices increased, particularly eggs, while clothing prices fell. Core inflation was at 0.4%, indicating persistent inflation risks. The Fed&#x27;s future policies may be influenced by Trump&#x27;s tariff plans, which could affect both prices and economic growth.",
