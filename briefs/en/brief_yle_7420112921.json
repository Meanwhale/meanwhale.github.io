    "news_text": "In South Korea, the birth rate has plummeted to a record low, with predictions of a total fertility rate of 0.68 by 2024. Companies like Booyoung are offering significant bonuses to employees for having children, but many South Koreans, particularly young women, cite financial concerns and a desire for career fulfillment as reasons for not wanting children. The country has seen dramatic urbanization and rising living standards, leading to children being viewed as financial burdens rather than assets. Despite government efforts over the past 25 years to encourage higher birth rates, including improved childcare and financial incentives, these measures have largely failed. Attitudes towards childbearing have shifted significantly, with many young women no longer feeling a societal obligation to have children. The low fertility issue is not unique to South Korea, as similar trends are observed in Japan and China, raising concerns about the long-term demographic and economic implications.",
