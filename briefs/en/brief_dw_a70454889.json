    "news_text": "The Russian telecoms regulator, Roskomnadzor, banned Discord, citing its inability to prevent messaging for terrorist activities, drug sales, and illegal content. This followed a previous fine for not removing banned material. The ban has faced criticism, especially from pro-military bloggers who noted its use by Russian forces in Ukraine. Turkey's BTK also blocked Discord, citing the need to protect children from online abuse. Discord has faced scrutiny in the US for its role in grooming minors and facilitating criminal activities. The platform, popular for its communication features, has been criticized for lax content moderation, allowing extremist groups to thrive, despite claims of improved safety measures.",
