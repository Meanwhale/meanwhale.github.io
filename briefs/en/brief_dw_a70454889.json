    "news_header": "Russia and Turkey have banned Discord due to concerns over its use for illegal activities and failure to comply with content removal requests.",
    "news_text": "The Russian telecoms regulator, Roskomnadzor, banned Discord, citing its inability to prevent the app's use for terrorism, drug sales, and illegal information sharing. This decision followed a previous fine for not removing banned content. The ban has faced criticism from pro-military bloggers who claim it hampers Russian forces' coordination in Ukraine. Similarly, Turkey's BTK communications authority blocked Discord to protect children from online abuse, following investigations into blackmail and harmful content. Discord has faced scrutiny in the U.S. for its role in grooming minors and facilitating criminal activities. The platform, which has over 150 million users, has been criticized for its content moderation practices and has been linked to various criminal cases and extremist activities.",
