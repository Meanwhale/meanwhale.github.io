    "news_text": "President Donald Trump has ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminum entering the US, marking a significant expansion of trade barriers. The tariffs aim to increase domestic production, but have raised concerns among US businesses and warnings of retaliation from Canada, the largest supplier. Trump stated that there would be no exceptions to the tariffs, which are set to take effect on March 4. He emphasized the need for steel and aluminum to be produced in America, suggesting that this is just the beginning of many tariffs aimed at protecting US industries. The move has been met with criticism from Canadian officials and industry leaders, who argue it could harm the North American economy.",
