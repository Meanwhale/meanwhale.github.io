    "news_text": "President Donald Trump has announced a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminum entering the U.S., expanding existing trade barriers. This move, effective March 12, is intended to increase domestic production, although it raises concerns about retaliatory measures from Canada and other nations. Canadian officials and industry leaders have criticized the tariffs as unjustified, warning of negative impacts on U.S. industries reliant on these imports. The tariffs are part of Trump&#x27;s broader economic strategy, which he believes will strengthen the U.S. economy and create jobs, despite potential cost increases for consumers.",
