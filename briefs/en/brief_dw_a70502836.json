    "news_text": "The conflict in Sudan has escalated, particularly in the capital Khartoum, where the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) are attempting to reclaim areas controlled by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Since April 2023, the civil war has led to at least 20,000 deaths and displaced over 11 million people, creating a severe humanitarian crisis exacerbated by famine and disease outbreaks. Recent shelling in markets has resulted in civilian casualties, and humanitarian aid is severely restricted due to ongoing violence and looting by RSF. Local emergency responders are struggling to provide support, and the situation in refugee camps is dire, with reports of malnourished children lacking aid. Experts indicate that the conflict has become increasingly complex, with factionalism complicating the power struggle between the SAF and RSF, leading to a chaotic and fragmented command structure. Calls for immediate humanitarian intervention are growing as conditions deteriorate.",
