    "news_original_title": "Infant mortality rises in US states with abortion bans, study finds",
    "news_text": "The study highlighted that restrictive abortion policies could reverse progress in reducing infant deaths, particularly affecting disadvantaged populations.

The research also linked abortion bans to increased fertility rates in these states.",
