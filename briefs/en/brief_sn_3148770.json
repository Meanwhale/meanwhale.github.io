    "news_text": "The U.S. FDA has proposed a rule to significantly reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes and other combusted tobacco products to assist smokers in quitting. The plan suggests that reduced-nicotine cigarettes would contain less than 5% of the nicotine found in regular cigarettes, potentially aiding smokers in decreasing their daily intake and transitioning to less harmful nicotine delivery methods. Research indicates that lower nicotine levels can lead to reduced smoking rates without increasing cravings or withdrawal symptoms. The initiative aims to provide smokers with more options to overcome their addiction.",
