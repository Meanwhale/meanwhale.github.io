    "news_header": "South Korea's Constitutional Court held a brief hearing regarding the impeachment of suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol, who did not attend due to safety concerns amid a warrant for his arrest.",
    "news_text": "The Constitutional Court of South Korea conducted its first hearing on whether suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol should be removed from office following his controversial martial law attempt. The hearing lasted only four minutes due to Yoon's absence, as he is facing a warrant for arrest related to insurrection charges. Yoon was suspended after a parliamentary vote for impeachment in December, and he will only be formally removed if six out of eight justices vote to uphold the impeachment. The court must schedule a new hearing date to proceed without Yoon's participation. His lawyers have indicated he will attend at a later date but have challenged the court's decisions. Yoon has not made public comments since the impeachment vote, and he is also facing a separate arrest attempt for alleged insurrection. The political crisis has affected South Korea's economy, with the currency weakening and concerns raised by credit rating agencies.",
