    "news_text": "In Finland, wage increases have lagged behind most European countries, resulting in a substantial decline in purchasing power for wage and salary earners since 2021. Factors such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, rising energy prices, and increased interest rates have contributed to this decline. Real earnings per hour worked have decreased by 2.5%, while the euro area average is only a 1% decline. Although inflation in Finland has been the slowest in Europe, wage growth has been similarly subdued. Comparatively, Finland is about 2% away from restoring purchasing power on a European scale, with a 4% gap when assessed domestically.",
