    "news_text": "Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, daughter of former South African President Jacob Zuma, faces charges related to her involvement in the 2021 riots that resulted in over 300 deaths. The riots erupted following Zuma's imprisonment, leading to widespread violence in Durban and Gauteng. Zuma-Sambudla, a senior member of the uMkhonto WeSizwe party, allegedly shared provocative social media posts that incited unrest. She is expected to appear in court, and while she has not directly commented on the charges, she has made cryptic posts on social media. The riots are among the bloodiest events in post-apartheid South Africa, with significant economic impacts and a history of political controversy surrounding Zuma's presidency.",
