    "news_text": "Researchers have developed AI-designed proteins that can neutralize snake venom toxins, potentially leading to new treatments for snakebites. In experiments, these proteins saved mice from lethal doses of cobra venom. The work builds on previous Nobel Prize-winning research and represents a significant advancement in antivenom technology, which has been stagnant due to high costs and outdated methods. The next steps involve ensuring the safety of these proteins for human use.",
