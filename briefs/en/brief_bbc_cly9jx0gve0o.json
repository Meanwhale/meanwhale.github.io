    "news_original_title": "India cuts interest rates for the first time in five years",
    "news_text": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has reduced its repo rate from 6.5% to 6.25% to combat slowing economic growth, which is projected to hit a four-year low of 6.7%. RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra indicated a 'neutral' policy stance, suggesting potential further rate cuts. The decision comes as investment growth and urban consumption decline, although moderating inflation and increased rural demand may support growth. The rate cut could lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. This follows previous measures to inject liquidity into the banking system and a tax cut for the middle class, despite the government's aim to reduce spending. Economists anticipate further rate cuts due to limited fiscal stimulus, but global uncertainties pose challenges.",
