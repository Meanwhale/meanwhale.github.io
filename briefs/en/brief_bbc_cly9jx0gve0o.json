    "news_original_title": "India cuts interest rates for the first time in five years",
    "news_text": "The Reserve Bank of India has reduced its repo rate from 6.5% to 6.25% to address slowing economic growth, which is projected to hit a four-year low of 6.7%. The RBI governor stated the policy stance remains &#x27;neutral&#x27; to allow for further support of growth. The rate cut may lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. This decision follows previous measures to inject liquidity into the banking system and a tax cut for the middle class, despite challenges from global uncertainties and a depreciating currency.",
