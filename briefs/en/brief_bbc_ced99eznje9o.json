    "news_text": "Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has responded to Israeli strikes on Iranian military sites, urging a balanced perspective without promising immediate retaliation. President Masoud Pezeshkian echoed this sentiment, stating Iran does not seek war but will defend its rights. The Israeli strikes, which followed Iranian missile attacks on Israel, reportedly caused limited damage, with Khamenei adopting a more restrained tone compared to his usual rhetoric. Meanwhile, fighting continues between Israel and Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon and Gaza, with significant casualties reported. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi proposed a temporary ceasefire in Gaza, but Hamas maintains its demands for a complete ceasefire and withdrawal. The ongoing conflict has resulted in thousands of casualties in Gaza since the escalation began.",
