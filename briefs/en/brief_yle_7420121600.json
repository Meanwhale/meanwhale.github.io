    "news_text": "A year ago, the University of Lapland received two reports of good scientific practice related to the dissertation process. The Faculty Council rejected T\u00f6rh\u00f6nen\u2019s dissertation in December, following a careful review. Rector Antti Syv\u00e4j\u00e4ven stated that pre-inventors G\u00f6te Nyman and Ilkka Huovio, along with directors Mauri Up-Kotola and Kaarina, were not guilty of ignorance. The decision was based on a research team report. T\u00f6rh\u00f6nen's adjustment claim was rejected, and an appeal is currently ongoing. The university has temporarily suspended the rectification application while investigating the allegations of good scientific practice violations.",
