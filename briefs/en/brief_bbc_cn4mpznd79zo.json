    "news_text": "The UK is experiencing economic stagnation, with forecasts suggesting a continuation into the early part of the year. Interest rates may be cut to 4% or lower, but inflation risks are rising due to higher energy prices. A technical recession is narrowly avoided, but growth is expected to be just 0.75% this year, with unemployment rising to just below 5%. The Bank of England is cautious about cuts due to uncertainties surrounding President Trump's trade policies and their impact on the economy.",
