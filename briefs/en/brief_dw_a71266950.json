    "news_text": "Germany is set to hold snap federal elections on February 23, 2025. Elon Musk, a tech billionaire and Trump associate, has publicly endorsed the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a party partially labeled as right-wing extremist. Musk believes the AfD is the only party that can save Germany and has offered to engage in a conversation with its leader, Alice Weidel, on social media. The AfD is notably active on platforms like TikTok, where their content reaches a large audience. Experts warn that social media can create 'filter bubbles' that reinforce existing beliefs while ignoring opposing views. Despite the influence of social media, research indicates that electoral decisions are shaped by a variety of factors, including personal experiences and social interactions. The rise of misinformation on platforms like Facebook and Instagram poses additional challenges for voters. Overall, while social media can amplify certain messages, it is essential to contextualize discussions and recognize that they may not accurately reflect societal views.",
