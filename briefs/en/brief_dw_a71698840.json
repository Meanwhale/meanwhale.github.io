    "news_original_title": "AI disinformation could threaten Africa&#x27;s elections",
    "news_text": "Deepfakes and AI-generated disinformation are becoming increasingly prevalent, posing significant threats to democratic processes, particularly during elections. The Konrad Adenauer Foundation&#x27;s study highlights that these campaigns often aim to undermine electoral authorities and sow division within societies. While Europe and Africa face similar challenges, access to the internet in many African nations limits the spread of deepfakes. The study notes that AI disinformation is often used by extreme right political parties and state-linked groups, with Russia and China being prominent actors. In South Africa, the Real411 platform allows voters to report disinformation, indicating a growing awareness of the issue. Recent conflicts, such as in the Democratic Republic of Congo, have further fueled the spread of disinformation, complicating the political landscape. The need for clear and truthful information is emphasized, as well as the importance of diverse news sources to combat manipulation.",
