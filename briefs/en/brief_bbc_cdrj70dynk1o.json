    "news_text": "A water company, United Utilities, has been found to have illegally discharged more than 140 million liters of raw sewage into Windermere, one of England's renowned lakes, from 2021 to 2023. This illegal activity went largely unreported, with the company admitting that some discharges were 'potentially non-compliant.' The sewage releases, which were supposed to be limited to specific conditions during wet weather, resulted in significant environmental damage, including harmful algal blooms. Despite the company's claims of transparency, internal sources indicated awareness of the illegal discharges, raising questions about regulatory compliance. The Environment Agency is now investigating the matter, and there are calls for stricter penalties for water companies that fail to adhere to environmental regulations.",
