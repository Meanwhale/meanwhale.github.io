    "news_text": "A water company, United Utilities, has been found to have illegally discharged over 140 million litres of raw sewage into Windermere, one of England's renowned lakes, over a three-year period from 2021 to 2023. The company failed to report most of these incidents, which were more extensive than previously known. While United Utilities acknowledged some discharges were 'potentially non-compliant,' they claimed to self-report a majority of pollution incidents. Environmental campaigners criticized the company for treating Windermere like an 'open sewer.' The Environment Agency has launched an investigation into these breaches, and the BBC's analysis revealed that United Utilities had been aware of the illegal discharges but did not report them, raising concerns about accountability and environmental protection. The company has since promised to implement changes to prevent future incidents and is under scrutiny from regulators regarding its environmental performance.",
