Country Director Suvi Tupurainen stated that there is currently no indication of a hacker or cyber attack. The bank requires a predetermined counter-account in another bank to prevent unauthorized withdrawals. While transactions and orders were still possible, the exact status of operations was unclear. Following the announcement, Nordnet&#x27;s share price fell by 5% on the Stockholm Stock Exchange, marking its largest decline in two weeks. The services are expected to be restored as soon as possible.",
