    "news_text": "Michel Barnier, appointed as France's Prime Minister, is tasked with navigating the 2025 budget through a parliament where he lacks a majority. The budget deficit is projected to exceed 6% of GDP, up from an initial estimate of 4.4%. Barnier's plans, to be revealed on October 10, aim to reduce the deficit to 5% next year and 3% by 2029, relying on cuts to public spending and potential tax increases for the wealthy and corporations. Economic experts express concerns about the implications of drastic spending cuts on private consumption and economic growth. The left-wing opposition has already announced plans to challenge the budget, complicating Barnier's efforts. The situation is further complicated by rising public debt, currently around \u20ac3.2 trillion, and the need for a solid plan to satisfy both domestic and EU expectations.",
