    "news_text": "Michel Barnier, appointed as France's Prime Minister, is tasked with navigating the 2025 budget through a parliament where he lacks a majority. The budget deficit is projected to exceed 6% of GDP, significantly higher than the initial estimate of 4.4%. Barnier's policy speech highlighted the urgency of the situation, referring to it as a 'sword of Damocles.' The government aims to reduce the deficit to 5% next year and 3% by 2029 through spending cuts and tax increases, particularly targeting the wealthy and corporations. However, there is concern that drastic cuts could harm economic growth. The left-wing opposition has already signaled intentions to challenge the budget, and Barnier may need to use a special constitutional provision to push it through. Economic experts express mixed views on the government's strategy, with some advocating for increased public investment instead of cuts. The political landscape remains tense, with protests against budget cuts occurring across France.",
