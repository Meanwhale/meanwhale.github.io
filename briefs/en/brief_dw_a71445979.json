    "news_text": "HIV is often described as a &#x27;time bomb&#x27; due to its ability to hide in cells, making it difficult to cure. Antiretroviral drugs can suppress the virus but do not eliminate it. Current research includes stem cell therapies and T-cell therapies, which aim to eradicate HIV-infected cells. While seven people have been cured through stem cell transplants, this method is not widely applicable. Experts remain hopeful about finding a cure, comparing the challenge to the efforts that led to landing on the moon.",
