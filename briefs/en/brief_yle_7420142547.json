    "news_text": "On Sunday, the Federation of Industry rejected a proposal from the Reich Mediator regarding the ongoing work dispute in the technology sector. Economic experts, including Aki Kangasharju and Mika Maliranta, discussed the pressure for a resolution, the potential impact on labor negotiations in other sectors, and the broader implications for Finland&#x27;s economy. Workers are demanding a 10% wage increase, while the mediator&#x27;s proposal offered a 7% increase over three years. The experts noted that the situation could lead to delays in other negotiations and warned of potential strikes if the deadlock continues.",
