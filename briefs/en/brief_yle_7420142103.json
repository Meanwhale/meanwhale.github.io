    "news_text": "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing sanctions against the International Criminal Court (ICC) in response to its reports involving US citizens and allies like Israel. This action comes despite the US Senate's earlier vote against such sanctions. The sanctions will include financial restrictions and visa bans for individuals involved in ICC investigations. The ICC had previously issued arrest warrants for Israeli officials and Hamas leaders for war crimes in Gaza. Trump described the ICC's actions as a 'dangerous precedent.'",
