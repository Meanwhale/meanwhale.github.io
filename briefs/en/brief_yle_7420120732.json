    "news_text": "The new labor market indicators in Finland suggest a moderate improvement, although there are significant regional and sectoral differences. Most regions face a serious oversupply of labor, with a mismatch between the skills of unemployed individuals and employer needs. However, the economic outlook is expected to brighten, with one-third of regions anticipating better business conditions in six months. The economy is projected to grow by next spring, but improvements in employment will lag. There is a growing demand for social and health professionals, as well as in transportation and technology sectors. Despite an increase in unemployment, which reached 8.4% in September, many employers are hesitant to make layoffs, hoping for better economic conditions. The overall labor market is expected to evolve, with investments in green sectors likely to create more job opportunities.",
