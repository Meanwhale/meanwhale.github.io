    "news_header": "Neste has withdrawn from a major hydrogen project in Porvoo due to regulatory challenges and financial concerns.",
    "news_text": "Neste has decided to retreat from its significant hydrogen investment project at the Porvoo refinery, which aimed to produce renewable hydrogen through electrolysis to replace grey hydrogen and support Finland's emissions reduction goals. The company's CEO, Heikki Malinen, cited poor crew conditions, regulatory issues, and the need to maintain financial stability as reasons for the withdrawal. Despite being the largest hydrogen user in Finland, Neste's profitability has declined, with a significant drop in operating margins and slower-than-expected demand for renewable fuels. The company faces increasing competition and must enhance its competitiveness and efficiency. Experts express disappointment over the project's cancellation, highlighting the challenging market conditions and regulatory hurdles that hinder progress in hydrogen investments.",
