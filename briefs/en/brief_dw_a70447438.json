    "news_text": "A study led by Erica Hartmann from Northwestern University found over 600 unique viral species, mainly bacteriophages, living on showerheads and toothbrush bristles in American bathrooms. These viruses, which primarily infect bacteria rather than humans, highlight the untapped biodiversity in everyday environments. The research utilized data from citizen science projects and emphasized the importance of understanding these microbial communities for improving living space quality. Hartmann suggested that bacteriophages could be used to combat harmful bacteria and reduce reliance on antimicrobial products. The findings contribute to ongoing investigations into microbial life in domestic settings and its implications for health.",
