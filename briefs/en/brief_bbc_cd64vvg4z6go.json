    "news_text": "A23a, the largest iceberg in the world, is on a collision course with South Georgia, a British territory known for its wildlife. Currently 173 miles away, the iceberg poses a risk to penguins and seals, as previous icebergs have caused significant wildlife deaths in the area. A23a, which broke off from Antarctica in 1986, is slowly decaying and could break into large segments at any moment. Scientists are monitoring its movements closely, as it could impact local fisheries and ecosystems. The iceberg's melting may also affect the carbon cycle in the Southern Ocean by releasing nutrients and chemicals into the water.",
