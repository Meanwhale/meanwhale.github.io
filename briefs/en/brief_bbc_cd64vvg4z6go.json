    "news_text": "A23a, the largest iceberg in the world, is on a collision course with South Georgia, an important wildlife area. Currently 173 miles away, it poses a danger to penguins and seals as it could ground and break apart. The iceberg, which calved from Antarctica in 1986, is slowly decaying and could break into large segments at any time. Past icebergs have already caused significant wildlife casualties in the region. Scientists are monitoring A23a's movements, and its melting could impact the ocean's carbon cycle by releasing nutrients and chemicals. The situation highlights the increasing threat of icebergs to both wildlife and fisheries in the area.",
