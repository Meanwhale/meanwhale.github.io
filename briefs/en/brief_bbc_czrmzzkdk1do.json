    "news_text": "In a significant political event in Kenya, Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua was impeached by the Senate after he failed to attend his trial, citing health problems. Despite his absence, the senators proceeded with the trial and upheld five charges against him, including inciting ethnic divisions. Gachagua, who had pleaded not guilty to 11 charges, described the impeachment as a 'political lynching.' Following the impeachment, President Ruto nominated Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki as Gachagua's successor. This decision reflects ongoing political tensions and consolidates Ruto's authority, especially after Gachagua's recent fallout with him.",
