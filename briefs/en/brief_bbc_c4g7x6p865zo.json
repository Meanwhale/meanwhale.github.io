    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a \u00a340bn tax rise, primarily impacting employers through increased National Insurance rates and reduced thresholds. This will generate \u00a325bn annually but is seen as detrimental by businesses, which warn it could hinder economic growth. While some small firms receive relief, the overall burden could lead to higher consumer prices and limited wage increases. Business leaders describe the Budget as tough, with significant implications for hiring and investment. Some firms, however, view the changes as manageable.",
