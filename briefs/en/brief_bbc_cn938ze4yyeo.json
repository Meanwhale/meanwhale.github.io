    "news_text": "Scientists warn that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), which helps keep the UK warmer than expected, is weakening. This could lead to colder winters in the UK and north-west Europe, despite global warming. Evidence suggests Amoc has already slowed, and while a complete collapse is uncertain, the risks are increasing. A tipping point could lead to significant climate disruptions, including more winter storms and global consequences like shifts in tropical rain belts. The UK government has not adequately prepared for these risks, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions is crucial to mitigate potential impacts.",
