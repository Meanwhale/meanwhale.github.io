    "news_text": "Niger's military leaders have begun renaming streets and monuments that bear French names as part of an effort to distance the country from its colonial past. Notably, Avenue Charles de Gaulle in Niamey has been renamed Avenue Djibo Bakary, honoring a key figure in Niger's independence. The junta spokesman highlighted that many street names serve as reminders of the suffering endured during colonization. Following the ousting of President Mohamed Bazoum, Niger's relations with France have soured, leading the country to seek military support from Russia, similar to its neighbors Mali and Burkina Faso. A recent ceremony in Niamey marked the name changes, including a war memorial now dedicated to all victims of colonization. Other changes include replacing the image of a French colonial officer with that of Thomas Sankara, a revolutionary leader, and renaming Place de La Francophonie to Place de l'Alliance des Etats du Sahel, reflecting Niger's new alliances.",
