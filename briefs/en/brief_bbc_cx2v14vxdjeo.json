    "news_text": "In Darwin Harbour, ranger Kelly Ewin works to manage the population of saltwater crocodiles, which were nearly hunted to extinction 50 years ago but have rebounded significantly since hunting was banned in 1971. With an estimated 100,000 wild crocs in the Northern Territory, Ewin's job involves capturing and often euthanizing crocodiles that pose a threat to humans. Education programs like 'Be Crocwise' aim to teach the public how to coexist with these predators. While farming crocodiles for luxury goods has become an economic driver, concerns about animal welfare persist. The ongoing debate about crocodile management reflects the complex relationship between humans and wildlife in the region.",
