    "news_text": "Donald Trump has officially won the US presidential election, set to take office again in January 2025. With over 72 million votes, he surpassed Kamala Harris, who received under 68 million. While some world leaders celebrate his victory, many in Western Europe express shock. Trump's support among minority voters increased significantly compared to 2020, particularly among Black and Latino voters. Young men also favored Trump, influenced by his social media outreach. Economic issues, particularly inflation, played a crucial role in his victory, overshadowing topics like abortion rights that appealed more to women. Concerns about Trump's potential policies on Ukraine and NATO remain.",
