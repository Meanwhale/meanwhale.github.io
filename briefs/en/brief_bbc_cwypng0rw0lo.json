    "news_text": "Donald Trump indicated he would likely extend TikTok's ban for 90 days, pending further evaluation, as he prepares to assume the presidency. This comes after TikTok warned it would 'go dark' unless the Biden administration assured that the ban wouldn't be enforced. The Supreme Court upheld a law requiring TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app by January 19. Trump mentioned he had discussed TikTok with China's President Xi Jinping and acknowledged the app's popularity among American users, while also expressing concerns about national security. TikTok's CEO is expected to attend Trump's inauguration.",
