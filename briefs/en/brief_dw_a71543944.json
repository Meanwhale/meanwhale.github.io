    "news_text": "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing sanctions on unnamed officials at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in response to arrest warrants issued for Israeli leaders Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, as well as deceased Hamas officials for alleged war crimes in Gaza. Trump criticized the ICC&#x27;s actions as illegitimate and warned of significant consequences for those involved. The move has drawn condemnation from 79 countries, which argue it undermines international law and could jeopardize the safety of victims and witnesses. The ICC has vowed to continue its work despite the sanctions, while experts warn of a chilling effect on international justice efforts.",
