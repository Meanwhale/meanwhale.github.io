    "news_text": "As the US presidential election approaches, Canadians and Mexicans express concern over its potential impact on their economies and relations with the US. In Canada, residents like Ernie in Fort Erie avoid political discussions, while others engage in debates, especially after drinks. In Juarez, Mexico, Sofia Ana highlights the importance of US relations for employment opportunities. The trade between the US and its neighbors is substantial, with Mexico being the largest trading partner. The election outcome could lead to significant changes, especially if Donald Trump wins, as he proposes high tariffs that could affect trade. Conversely, Kamala Harris is expected to maintain more open trade policies. Canadian farmers and business owners worry about the implications of a Trump presidency, while others believe he may strengthen the economy. The Canadian government is actively engaging with US officials to ensure a favorable relationship, regardless of the election outcome. Experts note that key issues like migration, security, and trade will remain central to US-Mexico relations post-election.",
