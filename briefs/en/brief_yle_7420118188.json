    "news_text": "Payment card data shows a rise in private consumption in Finland after spring and early summer, suggesting continued growth. OP economists maintain their forecast, predicting a 0.5% decline in the economy for this year, followed by a 2% increase next year and a 1% growth in 2026. Economic conditions for recovery have improved, particularly in the domestic market, while risks remain tied to export market developments. Inflation is expected to stay at 1%, with real wages rising. Interest rates may increase next year as the industrial cycle improves. Investments are anticipated to rise as construction begins to grow, although it remains below historical averages. Additionally, immigration is influencing population growth, with a demographic model indicating that migration could affect Finland's growth by up to 0.4 percentage points over the next five years.",
