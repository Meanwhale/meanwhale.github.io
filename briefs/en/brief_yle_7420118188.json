    "news_text": "Payment card data shows an increase in private consumption in Finland after spring and early summer, with expectations for continued growth. OP economists maintain their forecast, predicting a 0.5% decline in the economy this year, followed by a 2% increase next year and a 1% adjustment in 2026. Domestic economic growth is better than anticipated, though risks remain in export markets. Inflation is expected to stay at 1%, with real wages rising. Interest rates may increase next year as the industrial cycle improves. Investments are anticipated to rise as construction begins to grow, despite current levels being below historical averages. Population growth, influenced by immigration, is also factored into economic forecasts, with potential impacts on growth rates over the next five years.",
