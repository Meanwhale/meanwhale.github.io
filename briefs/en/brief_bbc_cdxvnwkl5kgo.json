    "news_text": "A Russian court has imposed a fine of two undecillion roubles on Google for limiting access to Russian state media channels on YouTube. This fine, amounting to $20 trillion, far exceeds Google's total worth and the global GDP. The fine doubles daily if unpaid, and it stems from actions taken after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with previous fines also imposed for similar reasons. The situation highlights ongoing tensions between Russia and Google amid severe restrictions on press freedom in the country.",
