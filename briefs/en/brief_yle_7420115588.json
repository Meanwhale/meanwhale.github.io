    "news_text": "Consumers are increasingly opting for cheaper meat options due to rising living costs, leading to a significant decline in reindeer meat sales. Traditionally popular products, like saut\u00e9ed reindeer, have seen a drop in demand by tens of percent. Reindeer herders are concerned about finding buyers for their meat, as large meat buyers already have ample stock. The situation is uncertain, with predictions for this year's sales being difficult. While some herders are considering direct sales and processing, the reliance on larger companies remains crucial, as not all herders can manage the entire meat production process. Despite challenges in meat sales, the tourism sector in Lapland continues to thrive, suggesting potential for reindeer meat sales in restaurants.",
