    "news_text": "The situation for mortgage holders improves with falling interest rates, but renters or those who have paid off their loans are better off according to Labor's example calculations. The report indicates that a significant slowdown in inflation enhances the purchasing power of nearly all families. Labor tracks the income, taxes, and purchasing power of eight hypothetical families, including high-income, employee, single educated, single-parent, unemployed, and retired couples. The report finds that wage increases and slower inflation will boost purchasing power for many families, particularly for those renting homes. However, single educated individuals face slower growth in purchasing power due to higher mortgage burdens. The purchasing power of single-parent families declines due to cuts in housing support, while the purchasing power of unemployed individuals receiving labor market support remains stable. Retired couples see the most significant increase in purchasing power this year, although wages are expected to rise faster than pensions in the following years.",
