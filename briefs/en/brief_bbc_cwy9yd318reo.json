    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that she has reached spending agreements with all government departments in preparation for her upcoming Budget, following tensions with various departments regarding necessary spending cuts. In a BBC interview, she confirmed that the traditional practice of popping balloons representing funding agreements has been completed. While acknowledging the challenges her colleagues face, Reeves emphasized the need for departments to find savings to balance the budget. Reports indicate unease within the Cabinet about the scale of cuts needed to achieve \u00a340 billion in savings. Despite some complaints from ministers about the impact of these cuts, Reeves maintained that any additional funding would require either reallocating funds from other departments or raising taxes. She expressed her commitment to rebuilding public services and acknowledged the influence of past Labour leaders on her approach. As the first female chancellor, Reeves also highlighted her pride in her role and the inspiration she draws from female finance ministers globally.",
