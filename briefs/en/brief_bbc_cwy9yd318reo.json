    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that she has reached spending agreements with all government departments in preparation for her Budget on October 30. This follows reports of disagreements within the Treasury regarding necessary spending cuts to address a \u00a340bn shortfall. In a BBC interview, Reeves acknowledged the challenges her colleagues face but emphasized the need for departments to find savings. She noted the tradition of popping balloons representing funding agreements as settlements are reached. Despite unease among cabinet ministers about potential cuts, Reeves stated that any additional funding must be balanced by either reallocating funds from other departments or raising taxes. She expressed her commitment to rebuilding public services and maintaining a good relationship with political figures, including her predecessor Jeremy Hunt. As the first female chancellor, Reeves also expressed pride in her role and drew inspiration from other female finance ministers globally.",
