    "news_text": "A new study suggests that muons, subatomic particles produced by cosmic rays, could be used to measure atmospheric pressure changes within supercell thunderstorms and their associated tornadoes. This technique allows for remote pressure measurements, potentially aiding in understanding tornado formation. Researchers propose using large detectors to capture muon data, with plans for initial testing this summer.",
