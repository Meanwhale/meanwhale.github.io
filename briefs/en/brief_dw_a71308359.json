    "news_text": "TikTok has returned to the US for now after briefly disappearing from app stores due to a potential ban linked to its parent company, ByteDance, needing to sell its US operations. Following President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to postpone the ban, TikTok's services were restored, but the app remains unavailable for download. The platform must secure a buyer to avoid a ban, as concerns about user safety and privacy persist. Advocates warn that a ban could push users to unsafe alternatives. The political landscape is fluid, with bipartisan support for a ban in April 2024, but TikTok has appealed the decision. Meanwhile, interest in acquiring TikTok has emerged from American companies, including a potential sale to Elon Musk's X. A US ban could set a global precedent, leading to more countries imposing restrictions on social media platforms. Advocates suggest comprehensive privacy legislation instead of targeting a single platform.",
