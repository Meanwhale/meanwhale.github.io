    "news_text": "TikTok is under pressure to sell its US operations by January 19, 2025, or face a ban due to national security concerns linked to its Chinese ownership. While some US lawmakers support the ban, critics argue it could push users to unsafe alternatives and fail to address broader privacy issues. The situation remains fluid, with potential acquisitions being discussed, including interest from Elon Musk. A ban could set a precedent for other countries to impose similar restrictions, leading to a fragmented internet. Advocates suggest comprehensive privacy legislation instead of targeting specific platforms.",
