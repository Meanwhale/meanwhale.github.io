    "news_text": "The Financial Supervisory Authority reports that about one third of real estate funds have suspended or limited redemptions, with ten funds already implementing such measures. The Titanium Fund is the latest to announce a temporary suspension of redemptions due to high demand and a stagnant real estate market. This action aims to protect the interests of all unit-holders and prevent forced sales. The situation has been deteriorating since 2023 due to rising interest rates, prompting many funds to extend redemption periods and ultimately suspend them. The authority plans to continue special supervision of these funds into 2025, focusing on the valuation of real estate.",
