    "news_text": "At a reproductive rights event in Paris, Maxime Labrit showcases colorful silicon rings aimed at revolutionizing male contraception. With over 2 billion sperm-producing individuals worldwide and a high rate of unintended pregnancies, Labrit emphasizes the need for more male contraceptive options. Current advancements include hormonal products like the NES/T gel and thermal methods that temporarily raise testicle temperature to reduce sperm production. Despite challenges in medical certification and funding, interest in male contraception is growing, supported by global studies and organizations like the Gates Foundation. The market for contraceptives is projected to reach $44 billion by 2030, highlighting the potential for change in gender-equitable birth control. The event participants express optimism about the future of male contraception as a means of empowerment for individuals in family planning.",
