    "news_text": "Nima Rinji Sherpa, an 18-year-old Nepalese teenager, has achieved a remarkable feat by becoming the youngest climber to summit all 14 of the world's highest peaks, known as the 'eight-thousanders.' He reached the summit of Mount Shishapangma in Tibet on Wednesday, marking the culmination of his journey that began at age 16 and took 740 days to complete. Alongside his climbing partner, Pasang Nurbu Sherpa, Nima has also set records for being the youngest to climb several notable Himalayan peaks, including Mount Everest and Lhotse. He aims to challenge the stereotype of Sherpas as mere guides, advocating for recognition of their potential as elite athletes. Nima comes from a family of accomplished mountaineers and hopes to inspire future generations of Sherpas to embrace their heritage and capabilities.",
