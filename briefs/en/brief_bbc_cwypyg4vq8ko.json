    "news_text": "A team of European scientists has successfully extracted a 2.8 km-long ice core from Antarctica, believed to be 1.2 million years old. This ice contains ancient air bubbles that could provide insights into the Earth's climate history, particularly during the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, a period when glacial cycles changed significantly. The project, called Beyond Epica: Oldest Ice, aims to understand climate changes and their potential links to human ancestors' near-extinction. The ice core will be analyzed by various European institutions to uncover more about our planet's past climate.",
