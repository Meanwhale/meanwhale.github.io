    "news_text": "Recent research has revealed engravings on stones at G\u00f6nnersdorf, a German site dating back nearly 16,000 years, showcasing scenes of net fishing. This discovery, made using advanced imaging techniques, positions G\u00f6nnersdorf as the only known Upper Paleolithic site in Europe, and possibly globally, to depict net fishing. The engravings include fish surrounded by crosshatched lines likely representing nets. Excavations at the site have previously uncovered various artifacts, including animal bones and figurines, indicating a rich cultural context. The findings suggest that the area was a seasonal gathering spot for hunter-gatherer groups engaged in fishing.",
