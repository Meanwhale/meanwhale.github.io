    "news_text": "According to a government analysis, Labour's plans to enhance workers' rights may impose costs of up to \u00a35bn per year on businesses, particularly affecting smaller companies that employ 13 million workers. This cost is deemed 'modest' at less than 1.5% of total employment expenses. The proposed measures include improved sick pay, protection from unfair dismissal, and a ban on zero hours contracts, which aim to enhance worker wellbeing, estimated to provide \u00a33bn in benefits. However, concerns have been raised about potential job cuts and economic growth impacts. Critics argue the legislation could lead to increased costs for businesses and uncertainty in the market, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. Proponents believe the reforms will benefit workers, particularly in sectors with insecure employment, and could reduce lost workdays associated with stress and anxiety.",
