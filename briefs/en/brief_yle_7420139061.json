    "news_text": "A restaurant in Norwich, England, has taken a strong stance against ham-pineapple pizza by pricing it at \u00a3100, claiming that canned pineapple is an inappropriate topping. This Hawaiian pizza, which originated in Canada in the 1960s, typically includes tomatoes, cheese, ham, and pineapple. Despite its popularity in various parts of the world, including Finland where it's called Tropicana, it is viewed negatively in Italy. A recent survey showed that about 50% of British respondents accept pineapple as a pizza topping, while 26% dislike it. The restaurant owner, Francis Wolf, emphasizes their disapproval of pineapple on pizza, and so far, no one has ordered the \u00a3100 pizza.",
