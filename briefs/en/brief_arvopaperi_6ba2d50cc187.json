    "news_text": "Oriola, a pharmaceutical wholesaler, has faced disappointing stock market performance since it became a separate entity from Orion in 2006, with only a 6% increase in share value. In contrast, Orion&#x27;s shares have significantly outperformed the market index. The company has two classes of shares, A and B, with differing voting powers, which has led to calls for merging the series to enhance liquidity and market value. Major shareholders, particularly Mariatorp, are advocating for this merger, citing potential benefits for attracting professional investors. However, previous attempts to merge the share series have faced opposition. The upcoming General Meeting will be crucial for determining the future of Oriola&#x27;s share structure, with the need for a two-thirds majority for approval.",
