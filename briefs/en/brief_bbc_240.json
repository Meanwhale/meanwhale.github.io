    "news_text": "Over 1,000 staff at TGI Fridays UK will be made redundant following a rescue deal by D&D London, which acquired the chain after its previous owner went into administration. While the deal preserves nearly 2,400 jobs across 51 restaurants, 35 branches have closed. TGI Fridays UK is negotiating with landlords to potentially reopen some of the closed locations. The new owners aim to modernize the brand while maintaining its heritage. However, concerns have been raised by the Unite union regarding the treatment of staff, including issues with wages and access to workplaces. The closures are attributed to the chain's inability to adapt its menu to changing consumer preferences.",
