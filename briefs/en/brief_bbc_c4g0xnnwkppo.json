    "news_text": "Sir Keir Starmer has announced a \u00a3200m investment in the Grangemouth site, which is transitioning from an oil refinery to a low-carbon energy hub. The UK government aims to protect jobs and support a just transition for workers affected by the refinery&#x27;s closure. The investment, part of the National Wealth Fund, is intended to attract private investment and develop new industries such as bioengineering and hydrogen energy. Scotland&#x27;s first minister, John Swinney, also pledged \u00a325m for a just transition fund. Unions have welcomed the funding but emphasize the need for detailed plans to ensure job security and effective use of the investment.",
