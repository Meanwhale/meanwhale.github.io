    "news_text": "A recent survey by the Theasia Ombudsman found that many e-commerce stores fail to clearly communicate discount pricing, with about half of the 50 surveyed stores showing deficiencies in how they report previous prices. The study highlighted that while some stores did report the lowest price from the previous 30 days, the information was often difficult to find or confusingly presented. Issues included unclear labeling of prices and inconsistent reporting of discounts based on inflated original prices. The Consumer Agency noted that the legislation regarding price reporting is still new and not well understood. The Ombudsman has updated guidelines to improve clarity, especially ahead of major sales events like Black Friday. Consumers are advised to track prices and verify the reliability of online stores, particularly those based outside of their country, and to use credit cards for online purchases to protect against non-delivery.",
