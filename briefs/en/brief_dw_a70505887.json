    "news_text": "In August, a US federal court determined that Google maintains a monopoly in internet search through unfair practices. This ruling is seen as a significant step in utilizing antitrust laws against major tech companies. The US Department of Justice is considering various remedies, including breaking up Google's parent company, Alphabet, and restricting its business practices. The case is now in the remedies phase, with the Justice Department expected to present detailed proposals by November. Meanwhile, Google faces similar scrutiny in the EU, where it has been fined multiple times for antitrust violations. Despite these challenges, Google argues it competes fairly and plans to appeal the ruling. The outcome of the US case could influence Google's future operations and market practices.",
