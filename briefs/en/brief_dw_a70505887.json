    "news_text": "In August, a US federal court determined that Google maintains a monopoly in internet search through unfair practices. This ruling is seen as a significant step in utilizing antitrust laws against major tech companies. The US Department of Justice is exploring various remedies, including breaking up Google's parent company, Alphabet, and imposing restrictions on its operations. The case is now in the remedies phase, with a detailed proposal expected by November. The European Union has also been scrutinizing Google's market dominance, imposing fines and implementing regulations to limit its power. Despite these challenges, Google argues it competes fairly and plans to appeal the ruling. The final decision on the US case may not arrive until late 2025.",
