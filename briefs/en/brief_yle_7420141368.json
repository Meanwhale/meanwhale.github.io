    "news_text": "A recent study published in Science Advances revealed that rat populations have increased in 11 out of 16 cities examined, attributed to global warming and urbanization. The study monitored rat numbers through complaints and observations over 7-17 years. The fastest growth was noted in cities like Washington DC and San Francisco, while some cities like Tokyo saw a decrease. The research highlighted that higher urban temperatures and urbanization rates significantly correlated with rat population growth, while green areas seemed to mitigate this increase. Experts suggest that cities must enhance waste management to control rat populations as temperatures rise.",
