    "news_text": "The US Justice Department has charged an Indian intelligence official in connection with a failed plot to assassinate Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a prominent Sikh separatist leader living in New York City. The suspect, who is still at large, is the second Indian national charged in this case. The FBI emphasized its commitment to protecting individuals exercising their rights in the US. The US State Department confirmed cooperation from Indian authorities, stating the indicted individual is no longer employed by the Indian government. This development follows heightened tensions between Canada and India over alleged attacks on Sikh leaders, leading to the expulsion of diplomats from both countries. Pannun remains undeterred in his advocacy for the Khalistan movement, accusing India of hiring hitmen from the Sikh community, which the Indian government denies.",
