    "news_text": "A previously unknown waltz attributed to Polish composer Frederic Chopin has been discovered in the vault of the Morgan Library and Museum in New York, nearly 200 years after it was composed. The manuscript, dated between 1830 and 1835, was found by curator Robinson McClellan while cataloguing collections. Although not signed by Chopin, the handwriting features his distinctive bass clef. McClellan, alongside a Chopin expert, is confident that the piece is authentically in Chopin's hand, despite some minor errors. He estimates a 98% certainty that it is composed by Chopin, noting its unique aspects and recognizable melody. Renowned pianist Lang Lang has recorded the waltz, which has garnered attention from the New York Times. Chopin, who primarily composed piano solos, passed away in 1849 at the age of 39.",
