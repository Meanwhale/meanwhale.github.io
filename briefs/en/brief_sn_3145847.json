    "news_text": "A significant Maya city, Valeriana, has been uncovered in southern Mexico, covering an area comparable to Beijing. This city exhibits features typical of a Classic Maya political capital, including plazas, temple pyramids, and a water reservoir. The discovery was aided by lidar technology, which mapped the landscape and revealed a high density of structures, with over 400 per square kilometer. This finding suggests that the Maya Lowlands were more densely populated than previously thought, challenging earlier assumptions about ancient Maya urbanization.",
