    "news_text": "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated that 'working people' would not see increased taxes on their payslips following the upcoming Budget. Labour's election pledge was to not raise National Insurance, income tax, or VAT on working individuals, but the definition of 'working people' has come under scrutiny. Phillipson clarified that it refers to those whose primary income comes from employment, avoiding specifics about business owners. The Labour government plans to address a \u00a322bn deficit left by the Conservatives, potentially leading to tax increases on asset sales and freezing income tax thresholds. While Phillipson committed to no higher taxes for working people, she acknowledged the government's tough choices ahead. Critics argue that the government is misleading the public about its fiscal plans. The Chancellor is expected to propose tax hikes to raise significant funds, which may impact businesses and employees. Additionally, the government has announced spending commitments for rebuilding schools and supporting foster care.",
