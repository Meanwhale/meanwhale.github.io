    "news_text": "The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is in jeopardy as the release of hostages and accusations of violations complicate negotiations. After the release of six Israeli hostages, Israel delayed the release of over 600 Palestinian prisoners, demanding Hamas cease its use of hostages for propaganda. Hamas accused Israel of disrupting the ceasefire. Tensions escalated with accusations of broken agreements and threats of resumed conflict. The fragile ceasefire process is under pressure, with the second phase of negotiations yet to begin. Hamas has proposed releasing remaining hostages in exchange for Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from Gaza, while Israel demands Hamas&#x27;s disarmament. The future governance of Gaza remains contentious, with conflicting proposals from various parties. Mediators from Egypt, Qatar, and the US face challenges in ensuring the ceasefire holds.",
