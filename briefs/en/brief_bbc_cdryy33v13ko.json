    "news_text": "The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is exploring ways to simplify mortgage lending rules established after the 2008 financial crisis to enhance access to home loans. This move follows a request from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and other officials for reforms to stimulate economic growth. The FCA is also contemplating removing the \u00a3100 limit on contactless card transactions. While lenders support these potential changes, concerns remain about ensuring consumer protection and the lessons learned from past financial crises.",
