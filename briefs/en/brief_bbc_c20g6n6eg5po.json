    "news_text": "Thomas Kwoyelo, a former commander of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), has been sentenced to 40 years in prison by a Ugandan court after being found guilty of 44 charges, including murder, rape, and kidnapping. He is the first LRA commander to be convicted in Uganda. The court considered his abduction as a child and expressed remorse, leading to a lesser sentence than life imprisonment or death. Kwoyelo will serve a total of 25 years, having already spent 15 years in remand. His lawyers plan to appeal the convictions. The LRA, notorious for its brutal tactics, has largely been dismantled, and the international effort to capture its leader, Joseph Kony, has been suspended.",
