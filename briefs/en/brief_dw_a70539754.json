    "news_text": "On Friday, Cuba's national electrical grid experienced a total shutdown due to a failure at the Antonio Guiteras power plant, affecting around 10 million people. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel stated that efforts to restore power were underway but would take time. Prior to the outage, non-vital government services had already been suspended due to ongoing electricity shortages. The situation was exacerbated by difficulties in fuel delivery caused by strong winds from Hurricane Milton, as well as the impact of the US trade embargo and sanctions. Cuban officials acknowledged worsening conditions but anticipated an influx of fuel supplies. Additionally, Venezuela, Cuba's largest oil supplier, has reduced shipments due to its own fuel scarcity.",
