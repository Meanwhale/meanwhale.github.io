    "news_text": "Georgians are heading to the polls to vote on whether to end 12 years of authoritarian rule, with significant implications for their aspirations to join the European Union. This election is viewed as one of the most important since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Pro-Western President Salome Zourabichvili supports a coalition of opposition groups aiming to unseat the ruling Georgian Dream party, which is expected to win a significant portion of the vote. Public sentiment largely favors EU membership, but the government has faced criticism for democratic backsliding and has been accused of using intimidation tactics against voters. The election is framed by the opposition as a choice between Europe and Russia, while the government warns that an opposition victory could lead to war. The political climate is highly polarized, with fears that the outcome may not be accepted by the losing side.",
