    "news_text": "Heikki HeAnen reports that Russia's leadership, including Dmitry Medvedev, has mixed feelings about Trump's presidency. While Medvedev expressed joy over Kamala Harris's defeat, he acknowledged that the military goals in Ukraine remain unchanged. Putin's cynical remarks about Harris's laughter contrasted with hopes for Trump's victory in 2016. Experts suggest that Trump's return could bring uncertainty to U.S. support for Ukraine, and while the Russian stock market reacted positively, many Russians view the election outcome as insignificant. Overall, Russia maintains that the U.S. is still its opponent, regardless of who occupies the White House.",
