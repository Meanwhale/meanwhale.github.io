    "news_text": "A new report from the Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW) highlights that the water cycle is out of balance, primarily due to the climate crisis and inadequate management of land and water resources. Over the next 25 years, more than half of the world's food production is at risk, with nearly three billion people facing decreasing water supplies. Freshwater demand is projected to exceed supply by 40% by the end of the decade, leading to potential GDP reductions of 8% in high-income countries and 15% in lower-income countries by 2050. The report cites severe water shortages affecting regions like Brazil, India, China, and southern Africa, emphasizing the need for better water management and support for vulnerable populations.",
