    "news_text": "Tom Hagen, one of Norway's richest individuals, had been suspected for over four years of involvement in the disappearance of his wife, Anne-Elisabeth Hagen, who went missing in October 2018. A ransom demand of $9 million was found at their home, with claims that she was alive, although police believed otherwise. In 2020, Hagen was arrested but released due to insufficient evidence against him. On Friday, prosecutors announced that he would no longer be considered a suspect, but the investigation into his wife's disappearance remains ongoing.",
