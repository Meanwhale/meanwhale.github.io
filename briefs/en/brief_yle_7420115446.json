    "news_text": "With the increasing demand for food innovation in occupied spaceflights, a team of students from Turku, Tampere University, and \u00c5bo Akademi has spent the summer modifying E. coli to produce vitamins A and C. They are participating in the ABOA2024 competition in Paris, focusing on the challenges of food production during long space missions. Traditional plant-based solutions are limited due to space and nutrient requirements, making bioreactor-based agriculture a more viable option. The project aims to ensure healthy and balanced food production for extended space travel, addressing the critical need for sustainable food sources in space. The team is also engaging the public with their project, including creating a woodbreaking book about their work with E. coli.",
