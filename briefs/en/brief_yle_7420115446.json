    "news_text": "A group of students from Turku and Tampere University and \u00c5bo Akademi has spent the summer working on a project to produce vitamins A and C using genetically modified E. coli for the ABOA2024 team competing in the world's largest international synthetic biology competition in Paris. Their approach aims to address food production challenges in long-duration space flights, as traditional plant-based solutions are space-consuming and slow-growing. The team emphasizes the importance of producing nutritious food efficiently in space, and their project has been a year in the making. The competition will evaluate not only their innovation but also their media outreach and public engagement efforts.",
