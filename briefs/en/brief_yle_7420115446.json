    "news_text": "A surge in interest for manned space missions has created a demand for food innovations. A group of students from Turku and Tampere universities, along with \u00c5bo Akademi, has spent the summer in a lab developing genetically modified E. coli bacteria to produce vitamins A and C. Their project, named ABOA2024, aims to address food supply issues in space using cell agriculture, which is seen as a faster and more efficient alternative to traditional plant-based food production. They will compete in the iGEM competition in Paris, specifically in the space category. The project has faced time constraints, preventing them from proving vitamin production, but they aim to create nutritious food solutions for long-duration space flights. The competition also evaluates media visibility and public engagement, with the team creating a children's activity book featuring their E. coli character. This marks the fifth participation of a team from Turku in iGEM, with interest growing at Tampere University for future participation.",
