    "news_text": "In Summerville, South Carolina, sightings of mysterious floating lights, known as the Summerville Light, may have a natural explanation linked to seismic activity. Geologist Susan Hough proposes that gases like radon and methane released during earthquakes could ignite and create these lights. Historical records show that the area has experienced significant earthquakes, including a major one in 1886. Hough&#x27;s research indicates that even small, undetected quakes could produce similar phenomena, suggesting that ghost stories in other regions might also be tied to subtle seismic activity.",
