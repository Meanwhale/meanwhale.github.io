    "news_text": "Crude oil prices fell further on Thursday, with March delivery dropping $0.42 to $70.61 a barrel, following a previous decline. President Trump reiterated his commitment to boosting U.S. oil production to lower prices, contributing to the downward pressure on oil. Additionally, a stronger U.S. dollar and a report indicating a significant rise in crude oil inventories by 8.7 million barrels last week added to the decline, surpassing economists' expectations of a 3.2 million barrel increase.",
