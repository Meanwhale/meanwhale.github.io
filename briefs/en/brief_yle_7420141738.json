    "news_text": "January 2025 marked the second warmest January in Europe since 2020, according to the EU climate service Copernicus. The global average temperature reached 13.23 \u00b0C, 0.79 \u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average and 1.75 \u00b0C higher than pre-industrial levels. Southern and eastern Europe, including western Russia, experienced the most significant temperature increases. This trend continues a series of record warm months influenced by human-induced climate change and exacerbated by El Ni\u00f1o. In Finland, temperatures varied widely, and ocean surface temperatures were also notably high. Arctic and Antarctic ice levels were below average, indicating ongoing climate shifts.",
