The mission aims to establish a permanent base on the Moon using a 4G network developed by Nokia. The Blue Ghost and Resilience landers will conduct research and send data back to Earth. Blue Ghost will reach the Moon in March, while Resilience is expected to land in late May or early June. Both missions face challenges, including harsh lunar conditions and the need for successful landings after previous failures.",
