    "news_text": "Russia has accelerated its military withdrawal from Syria, particularly from the Tartous port, following the fall of the Assad regime. Recent satellite images indicate that much of the military hardware has been removed, coinciding with reports of discussions between Russian officials and the new Syrian government. There are indications that the new government may have canceled Russia's lease at the port, which has been a crucial base for Russian operations in the Mediterranean. Two vessels linked to the Russian military have recently departed Tartous, and experts suggest that the equipment may be heading to Libya or back to Russia, potentially for use in the conflict against Ukraine.",
