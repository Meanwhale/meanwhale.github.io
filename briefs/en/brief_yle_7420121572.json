    "news_text": "The Information Centre will purchase Enfo from KPY if the Competition Authority approves the transaction. KPY is selling its subsidiary Enfo\u2019s entire share capital to Tietokeskus, creating the largest IT service company in Finland with 800 employees. The companies signed a contract on Tuesday, but trade prices are not public. Their combined revenue is approximately EUR 200 million. KPY will become a minority owner of the data center with about 10%. KPY is also committed to purchasing Enfo\u2019s consulting business, Epical. Enfo has faced losses in recent years, including a 7 million euro loss in 2022. KPY had to guarantee Enfo\u2019s loan in 2023, affecting its ability to pay interest to its owners. KPY has been the main owner of Enfo for nearly 20 years.",
