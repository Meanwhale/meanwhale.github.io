    "news_text": "The fading affect bias (FAB) distorts our memories, making positive experiences from childhood or the workplace seem more favorable over time, despite the reality of those moments. This bias is linked to optimism and mental health, as it helps individuals focus on positive experiences, which is believed to have evolutionary benefits for survival. Research indicates that FAB occurs even in children as young as eight. While it promotes mental well-being by enhancing positive recollections, it can also lead to a diminished ability to learn from negative experiences, potentially causing individuals to remain in unsatisfactory situations. Overall, FAB shapes our memories into a narrative that can support our psychological health, although it may also lead to a skewed self-perception.",
