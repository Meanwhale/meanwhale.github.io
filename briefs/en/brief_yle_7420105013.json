    "news_text": "The fading affect bias (FAB) is a psychological phenomenon that causes positive memories to fade more slowly than negative ones, leading to a distorted perception of past experiences. Research indicates that this bias increases with age and may be more pronounced among parents reflecting on nostalgic times. While FAB can enhance mental well-being by promoting optimism and hope, it also has drawbacks, such as hindering learning from negative experiences. This bias may result in individuals remaining in unsatisfactory situations, as they tend to forget the negative aspects of their past. Overall, FAB serves as a storytelling tool that shapes our experiences and influences our self-perception, often leading people to view themselves more favorably than they might objectively be.",
