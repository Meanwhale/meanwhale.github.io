    "news_text": "During a parliamentary inquiry, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau elaborated on the diplomatic tensions with India, stemming from allegations that Indian agents were involved in the murder of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil. Trudeau stated that Canada's national police had uncovered evidence linking Indian diplomats to this incident, leading to the expulsion of six Indian diplomats. He emphasized that Canada was not seeking to provoke India but needed to ensure the safety of Canadians. In response, India denied the allegations and accused Canada of failing to provide evidence, asserting that it had recalled its diplomats for safety reasons. The situation has escalated tensions between the two nations, with both sides expelling diplomats and India temporarily halting visa services for Canadians. Trudeau noted that his government had initially sought to handle the matter discreetly before going public due to India's lack of cooperation.",
