    "news_text": "The government is exploring changes to labor laws, including extending the strike mandate for workers from six months to a year and eliminating the requirement for a 50% workforce turnout for voting on industrial action. This follows significant industrial action across various sectors, resulting in over 5.7 million lost working days. The proposed Employment Rights Bill aims to improve workers' rights and facilitate union recognition, potentially lowering the threshold for union membership from 10% to 2%. Critics, including Conservative officials, argue that these changes could harm businesses, while unions welcome the government's commitment to modernizing industrial relations.",
