    "news_text": "Mount Fuji has not yet received any snowfall this year, marking the latest date on record for the mountain to remain bare since data collection began 130 years ago. Typically, snow appears by early October, but this year, warm temperatures have delayed it. Japan experienced its hottest summer on record, with temperatures significantly above average, and September continued to see warmer conditions. As of October, the wait for snow at the summit has extended beyond previous records, with the last snowfall occurring on October 5, 2023. Mount Fuji, Japan's highest mountain, stands at 3,776 meters and is a significant cultural symbol.",
