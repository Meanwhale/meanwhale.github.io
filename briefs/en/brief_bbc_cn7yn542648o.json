    "news_text": "Mikhail Pichugin, a 46-year-old Russian man, was rescued after spending 67 days adrift in a small inflatable boat in the Sea of Okhotsk. He was found nearly 1,000 km from his starting point, with the bodies of his brother and nephew still on the boat. Pichugin's wife expressed relief at his survival, attributing it partly to his initial weight and possibly catching fish during his ordeal. He is currently recovering in the hospital, while authorities have launched a criminal investigation into the incident. This case is reminiscent of past survival stories, including four Soviet soldiers who survived 49 days adrift in 1960.",
