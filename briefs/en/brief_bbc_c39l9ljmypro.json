    "news_text": "Laila Soueif, a 68-year-old maths professor, has not eaten for over three weeks while on a hunger strike in London, advocating for the release of her son, Alaa Abdel Fattah, Egypt's prominent political prisoner. Alaa, a pro-democracy activist, has been imprisoned for most of the last decade, with his family and human rights groups arguing he should never have been jailed. Laila's hunger strike, sustained by water and rehydration salts, symbolizes her family's desperation. Despite acquiring British citizenship, Alaa has not received consular visits from the UK, and his family is disappointed with the government's lack of action. They believe the UK has more leverage with Egypt than it utilizes. Laila hopes to pressure both the British and Egyptian governments through her strike, aiming for her son's freedom or to be hospitalized due to her deteriorating health. Alaa, who wishes to reunite with his son in the UK, is currently despondent about his future.",
