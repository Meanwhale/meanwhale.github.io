    "news_text": "Protests have erupted in Israel following Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's dismissal of Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who had disagreements over military strategy and hostage negotiations. Netanyahu cited a 'crisis of trust' between them, leading to Gallant's removal and the appointment of Foreign Minister Israel Katz as his replacement. Many protesters are calling for Netanyahu's resignation and demanding a focus on securing the release of hostages taken by Hamas. Gallant's removal comes amid ongoing tensions within Israel's government regarding military strategy and the treatment of ultra-Orthodox citizens in the military.",
