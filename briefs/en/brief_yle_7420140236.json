    "news_text": "Recent discoveries from asteroid Bennu confirm that asteroids may have played a crucial role in the emergence of life on Earth. Samples collected from Bennu revealed essential chemical ingredients for life, including traces of salt water and amino acids necessary for protein formation. These findings bolster the theory that asteroids delivered raw materials to Earth, supporting the idea that life could have originated beyond our planet. The samples were collected by NASA's Osiris-Rex probe and returned to Earth in 2023, providing direct evidence of the materials from space.",
