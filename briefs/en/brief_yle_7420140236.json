    "news_text": "Recent findings from samples collected from the Bennu asteroid indicate that asteroids may have played a crucial role in the formation of life on Earth. The samples contained essential chemical ingredients for life, including traces of salt water and amino acids necessary for protein synthesis. These discoveries bolster the theory that asteroids delivered raw materials to Earth, and the presence of these materials in space suggests that life could potentially exist elsewhere in the solar system. The samples were collected by NASA's Osiris-Rex probe and returned to Earth in 2023.",
