    "news_text": "Kenya's National Assembly has voted overwhelmingly to impeach Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, who faces 11 charges, including corruption and inciting ethnic divisions. The Senate is conducting a trial to decide his fate, with a two-thirds majority needed for removal. Gachagua, who denies all charges, has attempted to halt the impeachment through numerous court cases, but judges have ruled that the Senate should proceed. His impeachment is seen as likely due to support from ruling party senators and some opposition members. The trial has sparked significant public interest and debate, with some viewing it as a distraction from pressing economic issues in the country.",
