    "news_text": "A week after severe flash floods in eastern Spain resulted in at least 218 deaths, political tensions have escalated as leaders blame each other for the disaster response. Initial unity between regional and national leaders has deteriorated, with criticism directed at Valencia's regional leader, Carlos Maz\u00f3n, for his delayed response to weather warnings. The national leader of the People's Party, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, has questioned the meteorological agency's information and accused the prime minister of poor coordination. Amidst rising pressure for Maz\u00f3n's resignation, he has shifted blame to the CHJ hydrographic agency. The military's involvement has also sparked disputes over protocol. Public anger has manifested in protests against political leaders, prompting Maz\u00f3n to propose a \u20ac31.4 billion reconstruction plan, while Prime Minister S\u00e1nchez announced a \u20ac10.6 billion aid package.",
