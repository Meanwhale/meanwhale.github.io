His resentment towards Japan's perceived advantage in trade and military support shaped his views on tariffs, which he has consistently advocated as a tool to pressure foreign nations into fairer trade practices. Despite evolving global dynamics, Trump's belief in tariffs remains a cornerstone of his economic philosophy, reflecting a transactional approach to international commerce.",
