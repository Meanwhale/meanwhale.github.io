    "news_text": "On Wednesday, North Korea declared its intention to permanently shut off and block its southern border with South Korea, including cutting off roads and railways. The North's military described these actions as self-defensive measures in response to South Korean military exercises and the presence of US strategic nuclear assets. They also communicated with US forces to avoid misunderstandings. While these measures are seen as largely symbolic, they come amid heightened tensions and a long-standing halt in cross-border exchanges. South Korea's military criticized the announcement as a sign of desperation from the Kim Jong Un regime and vowed to respond strongly to any provocations. Additionally, North Korea has been reinforcing its border defenses and has reportedly begun demolishing sections of a railroad linking the two Koreas. Analysts suggest that this could lead to more serious changes in North Korea's policies, including constitutional amendments to redefine its relationship with South Korea.",
