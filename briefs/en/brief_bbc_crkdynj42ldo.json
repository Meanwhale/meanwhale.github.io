    "news_text": "Boohoo is undergoing a significant restructuring, considering the sale of its brands, including Debenhams, Karen Millen, and PrettyLittleThing, as it believes its business is 'fundamentally undervalued'. The company has faced challenges post-pandemic, competing with brands like Shein and Temu. Analysts suggest that focusing on younger markets by offloading Debenhams and Karen Millen could be beneficial. Despite previous attempts to shift towards sustainability, Boohoo has faced criticism for ethical practices and mislabeling. The company reported a 15% drop in sales to \u00a3620m for the six months ending in August and announced the departure of CEO John Lyttle, raising concerns about its future direction.",
