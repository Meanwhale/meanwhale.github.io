    "news_text": "Boohoo is planning a significant restructuring that may involve breaking up the company, which includes brands such as Debenhams and Karen Millen. The firm is reviewing its options after determining that it is 'fundamentally undervalued.' Despite benefiting from increased online shopping during the pandemic, Boohoo has faced challenges from competitors like Shein and Temu. Analysts suggest that selling off Debenhams and Karen Millen would allow Boohoo to concentrate on a younger demographic. The company has reported a 15% decline in sales, and its CEO, John Lyttle, will be leaving amid ongoing struggles with its youth brands. Additionally, Boohoo has faced criticism for not adhering to its sustainability promises and has been involved in controversies regarding mislabeling and supplier pressures.",
