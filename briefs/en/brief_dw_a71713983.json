    "news_text": "In Sofia, Bulgaria, clashes erupted between police and nationalist protesters opposing the government&#x27;s plans to adopt the euro. Thousands gathered, burning effigies of European officials and demanding the government resign. The protests, led by the ultra-nationalist Revival party, highlighted concerns about the euro&#x27;s impact on prices and called for a referendum. While some economists support euro adoption for foreign investment, many Bulgarians fear it could lead to inflation. The current government aims to join the eurozone by 2026, but public opinion remains divided amid ongoing political instability since Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007.",
