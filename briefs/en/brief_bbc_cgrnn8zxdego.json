    "news_text": "Raids to detain and deport undocumented migrants in the US are expected to start on the first full day of President-elect Donald Trump's administration. The operations, led by 'border tsar' Tom Homan, may begin in Chicago and target 'sanctuary' cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration officials. Trump has promised the largest deportation program in US history, prioritizing criminals and gang members. Despite previous lower numbers of deportations under Trump compared to Obama, a recent poll shows 55% of Americans support mass deportations. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency is preparing for these operations, which may also include raids at construction sites. The Laken Riley Act, requiring detention of undocumented migrants suspected of criminal activity, is expected to pass in Congress soon.",
