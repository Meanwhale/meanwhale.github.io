    "news_text": "Lindex Group intends to close the Stockmann department store located in the Itis shopping center in Helsinki. Negotiations regarding changes for the store's 35 employees will commence, with a timeline for these changes to be determined as negotiations progress. The lease for the store expires in August 2025, but no viable lease extension has been identified. The change negotiations are expected to last about six weeks, and the company will look into employment opportunities for affected staff at other locations. Stockmann operates several department stores in Finland and the Baltic region and has been present in the Eastern Centre of Helsinki since 1992. The company reported a loss of nearly EUR 4 million at the end of the previous year and plans to change its name from Stockmann to Lindex in spring 2024.",
