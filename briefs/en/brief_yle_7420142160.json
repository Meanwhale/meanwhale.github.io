    "news_text": "Lindex Group intends to close the Stockmann department store located in the Itis shopping center in Helsinki. Negotiations regarding changes will involve the entire staff of approximately 35 employees. The lease for the store is set to expire in August 2025, but no sustainable lease extension has been found. The company estimates that the change negotiations will take around six weeks and will explore employment opportunities for affected employees in other locations. Stockmann operates several stores in Finland and has an online shop. The company reported a loss of nearly EUR 4 million at the end of the previous year, and plans to change its name from Stockmann to Lindex in spring 2024.",
