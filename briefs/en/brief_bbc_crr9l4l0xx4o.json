    "news_text": "On Monday night, an Israeli airstrike hit the Jnah neighborhood in south Beirut, where 74-year-old Fouad Hassan was sitting on his balcony. No evacuation order was issued before the strike, which devastated the area, destroying residential buildings and resulting in significant casualties. Fouad's granddaughter was killed, and his grandson is in a coma. The airstrike is part of Israel's military campaign against Hezbollah, which has led to over 1,900 Lebanese deaths since September, including many civilians. Despite claims of targeting Hezbollah, the indiscriminate nature of the strikes has raised questions about the human cost of the military actions. As Fouad and his family cope with their losses, the community mourns the destruction and the lives taken by the airstrikes.",
