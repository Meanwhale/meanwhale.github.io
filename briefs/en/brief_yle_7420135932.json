    "news_text": "In recent years, quantum computing has seen breakthroughs, notably with Google's quantum chip that can solve complex calculations beyond traditional computers. Experts like Mikko M\u00f6tt\u00f6nen emphasize the rapid development in hardware and software, although practical applications remain elusive. The Google Willow chip demonstrated that quantum noise can be managed, leading to the creation of stable logical cubits from unreliable physical cubits. Despite the potential, significant challenges remain in finding suitable problems for quantum computers to solve efficiently. The market reacted cautiously to these developments, with predictions suggesting practical benefits may still be several years away.",
