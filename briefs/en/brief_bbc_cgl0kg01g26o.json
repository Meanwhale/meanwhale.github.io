    "news_text": "Roana, believed to be the oldest horse in the UK, celebrated her 46th birthday in County Down with a special cake made of linseed mash and grass pellets. Her owner, Cerys Brown, who has had a close bond with Roana for over 30 years, reminisced about their journey together, from competitive show-jumping in the 1990s to Roana&#x27;s role in Cerys&#x27;s life during challenging times, including her battle with Crohn&#x27;s disease. Cerys attributes Roana&#x27;s longevity to good care, feeding, and genetics. Roana&#x27;s personality is described as &#x27;thran&#x27; (stubborn), and despite her age, she remains lively and playful. The relationship between Cerys and Roana is highlighted as a beautiful partnership, reflecting advancements in horse care that allow horses to live longer, with Roana being a testament to this.",
