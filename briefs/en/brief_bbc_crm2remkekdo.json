    "news_text": "Leading UK business groups are alarmed by the possibility of an increase in National Insurance contributions for employers, which they believe could make hiring more difficult and stifle economic growth. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer did not dismiss the idea during a recent BBC interview. The CBI and other organizations warn that such a tax hike would particularly impact sectors like hospitality, where staffing costs are significant. The upcoming Budget on October 30 is expected to be challenging, with speculation about tax increases to address a \u00a322 billion shortfall in public finances. While Labour claims to be pro-business, concerns remain about their commitment to not raise National Insurance taxes. The implications of any changes could affect employer costs, employee wages, and overall economic activity.",
