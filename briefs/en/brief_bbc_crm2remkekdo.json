    "news_text": "Leading UK business groups have criticized the potential increase in National Insurance contributions for employers, suggesting it could impede hiring and economic growth. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer did not rule out the tax rise during a recent interview. The CBI and other lobby groups highlighted that such a hike could particularly impact sectors like hospitality, where staffing costs are significant. The government faces a \u00a322bn gap in public finances, prompting speculation about tax increases in the upcoming Budget. Changes to National Insurance could be implemented quickly, but economists warn that raising these contributions could have negative repercussions on overall tax revenue and business operations.",
