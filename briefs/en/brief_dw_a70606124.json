    "news_text": "US Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at a rally in Houston, Texas, emphasizing the importance of abortion rights just 11 days before the presidential election. She criticized former President Donald Trump for reversing progress on reproductive health by appointing Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. Harris warned that no state is safe from potential national abortion bans under Trump, who has promised to veto such legislation but faces pressure from evangelical supporters for stricter restrictions. The rally featured support from pop star Beyonce, who highlighted the significance of reproductive rights. Harris is currently neck-and-neck with Trump in polls, but leads among female voters.",
