    "news_text": "The US presidential election outcome will shape not only America's future but also Ukraine's fate, as the US has been a major supporter against Russia's invasion. President Biden has provided substantial military and financial aid, while Vice President Kamala Harris is likely to maintain support for Ukraine and European security. In contrast, Donald Trump has a complicated history with Ukraine and proposes a different approach, potentially favoring Russia in peace negotiations. The election's impact will also depend on Congressional majorities, as public support for the war in Ukraine has waned.",
