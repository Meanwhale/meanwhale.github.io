    "news_text": "In response to the growing energy demands of artificial intelligence, Google and Amazon have announced partnerships with companies developing small modular reactors (SMRs). These reactors, which produce less power than traditional nuclear plants, are designed with various fuel types and enhanced safety features. The U.S. government is also supporting SMR development, with significant funding allocated for their deployment. The shift towards smaller reactors aims to provide reliable, clean energy while addressing the challenges of large-scale nuclear projects. The interest in SMRs is rising as tech companies seek sustainable energy solutions amidst climate change concerns.",
