    "news_text": "Houthi rebels in Yemen have recently jailed numerous individuals for celebrating September 26, a date that symbolizes the birth of the Yemen Arab Republic, which the Houthis view as a threat to their legitimacy. They enforce September 21 as the national holiday, marking their takeover of Sanaa in 2014. The civil war has divided the country, with the Houthis controlling the northwest and the internationally recognized government in the south. The humanitarian situation is dire, with millions dependent on aid and rising hunger levels. The Houthis have also been arresting international aid workers, hindering humanitarian efforts. Amidst increasing pressure and paranoia, the Houthis are consolidating power and responding to external threats with further repression.",
