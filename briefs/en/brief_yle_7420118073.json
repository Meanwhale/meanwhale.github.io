    "news_text": "Arno Ahosniemi, CEO of the Finnish Financial Industries Federation, acknowledged the complexity of economics during the announcement of the Nobel Prize in Economics awarded to Daron Acemo\u011flu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Ainson. Their research explores why some countries thrive while others struggle, highlighting the significance of factors like good governance and societal stability. In Finland, discussions around government debt are ongoing, with differing opinions on necessary cuts. The Nobel laureates' findings stress that a successful economy does not solely rely on continuous growth but also on a well-functioning society. Tiina Helenius from Penke company emphasized that ownership rights and legal frameworks are crucial for motivating individuals to work towards success. The importance of democracy in fostering prosperity is a key theme in the Nobel winners' research, especially relevant in the context of current global challenges to democratic systems.",
