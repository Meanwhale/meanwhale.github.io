    "news_text": "Arno Ahosniemi, CEO of the Finnish Financial Industries Federation, highlighted the complexities of economics during the announcement of the Nobel Prize in Economics awarded to Daron Acemo\u011flu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Ainson. Their research explores why some countries thrive while others struggle, suggesting that factors beyond economic policies, such as democracy and good governance, play crucial roles. In Finland, discussions focus on government debt and necessary cuts, while the Nobel laureates' findings stress the significance of a stable society and ownership rights in fostering economic success. The importance of democracy is underscored, particularly as it faces challenges globally, including in the United States. Acemo\u011flu's previous works, including 'Why Countries Fall,' have gained recognition for their multidisciplinary approach to understanding prosperity and poverty across nations.",
