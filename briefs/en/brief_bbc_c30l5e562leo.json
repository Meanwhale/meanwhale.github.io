    "news_header": "A Texas judge has temporarily blocked the execution of Robert Roberson, the first man on death row for murder related to shaken baby syndrome, just before his scheduled execution.",
    "news_text": "Robert Roberson, sentenced to death in 2003 for the murder of his daughter, was granted a last-minute reprieve by a Texas judge, allowing him to testify at a legislative hearing. His conviction has been contested by a bipartisan group of lawmakers and experts who argue it was based on outdated science regarding shaken baby syndrome. Despite a previous denial of clemency by the Texas Board of Pardon and Paroles, Roberson's supporters, including law enforcement officials, maintain his innocence, citing alternative explanations for his daughter's death. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene, leaving the decision to Texas Governor Abbott.",
