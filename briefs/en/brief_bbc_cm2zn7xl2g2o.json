    "news_text": "Father Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez, a prominent Peruvian priest and theologian, passed away at the age of 96 in Lima. He is best known for founding liberation theology, a movement that encourages the Roman Catholic Church to actively combat poverty and injustice, which has faced criticism for its perceived Marxist leanings. His influential book, 'Theology of Liberation,' published in 1971, challenged the Church's traditional teachings and was both embraced and opposed within the Church. Guti\u00e9rrez's ideas were criticized by figures like Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who later became Pope Benedict, but he found support from Pope Francis, who acknowledged Guti\u00e9rrez's contributions to the Church and the poor. Before his priesthood, Guti\u00e9rrez studied various subjects in Europe, including philosophy and theology, and he argued that poverty is a human-made condition. Described as humble and approachable, he effectively communicated theological concepts to a broad audience and maintained a strong connection with his parishioners through various means, including officiating weddings and engaging in community activities.",
