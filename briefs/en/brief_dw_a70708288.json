    "news_text": "As the US wakes up post-election, Donald Trump appears set for another presidency, with Republicans controlling the Senate. His refined economic policies include tariffs on imports, a push for domestic manufacturing, tax cuts, and immigration reforms. These proposals have resonated with voters facing economic challenges. Global markets reacted mixedly, with some rising and others falling. Trump's stance on cryptocurrency has boosted Bitcoin, while concerns about tariffs have weakened various currencies, particularly in Mexico and Eastern Europe. Analysts warn that his second term could pose greater challenges for European industries.",
