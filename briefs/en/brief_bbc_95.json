    "news_text": "Sixty of the wealthiest people in the UK paid over \u00a33bn in income tax for the year 2021/22, accounting for about 1.4% of the total income tax receipts. Each of these individuals earned at least \u00a350m annually, and there are concerns that proposed tax increases in the upcoming Budget could lead to their departure, negatively impacting UK finances. While Labour has ruled out income tax changes, other tax hikes remain a possibility. The Institute for Fiscal Studies warns that even a small number of wealthy individuals leaving could create significant financial gaps. The Green Party disputes the notion that taxing the rich will drive them away, citing reasons for their residency in the UK. The government is considering reforms to the tax system, including the removal of the non-dom scheme, and discussions about an 'exit tax' have emerged as a potential solution to retain wealthy taxpayers.",
