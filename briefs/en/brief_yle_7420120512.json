    "news_text": "According to Statistics Finland, consumer purchases have risen to average levels, and the consumer confidence indicator increased slightly in October, reaching its highest level since February 2022. Compared to the previous year, views on the economy have significantly improved, and expectations for the Finnish economy have also risen. Despite this, consumers still perceive the timing for purchasing durable goods as unfavorable. However, interest in housing has grown due to lower interest rates and rising housing price expectations, especially among individuals aged 30-49 and 18-29. Regional purchasing preferences vary, with SMEs showing the most interest and Eastern Finland the least. The consumer confidence indicator rose to -6.8 in October from -8.1 in September.",
