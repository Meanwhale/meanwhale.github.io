    "news_text": "On October 30, the UK's Labour Party will unveil its first budget in more than 14 years, addressing a sluggish economy inherited from the Conservative Party. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has highlighted a significant public finance deficit. The government aims to balance tax promises and public investment needs, with potential tax increases of up to \u00a335 billion expected. Despite criticism over austerity measures, Labour is focused on improving public services and investment, with hopes that increased spending will offset negative reactions to tax hikes.",
