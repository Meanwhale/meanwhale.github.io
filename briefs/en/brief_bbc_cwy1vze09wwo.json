    "news_text": "French and Dutch authorities have raided Netflix's offices in Paris and Amsterdam as part of a tax fraud investigation that began in November 2022. The investigation, led by France's National Financial Prosecutor's office, focuses on suspicions of serious tax fraud and off-the-books work. Netflix has not commented specifically on the raids but maintains compliance with tax laws. The Amsterdam office serves as the headquarters for Netflix's operations in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Authorities are also examining Netflix's tax filings for 2019, 2020, and 2021, with reports suggesting that Netflix minimized its tax payments in France until 2021 by declaring revenue in the Netherlands. After changing this approach, Netflix's declared turnover in France surged significantly.",
