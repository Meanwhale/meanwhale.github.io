    "news_text": "On Tuesday, Nordean banking services faced disruptions, which have been a recurring problem for several weeks. The bank reported that the issues were resolved around 4:30 PM, with services gradually returning to normal. Earlier in the day, Nordean stated that the situation was under investigation, promising updates soon. By 4:30 PM, responses to inquiries made by Yle had not yet been received. The technical disruptions affected mobile and online banking functionalities, third-party service authentication, some card payments, and cash withdrawals from ATMs. The bank attributed the problems to a technical update conducted early in the morning, which limited customer service capabilities. Downdetector indicated a significant spike in service interruptions around 10 AM. Similar technical issues were reported in Sweden, with Nordean's communications team confirming that investigations were ongoing. The Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority expressed concern over the repeated service disruptions, emphasizing the importance of reliable banking services.",
