    "news_text": "In September, a significant landslide in Dickson Fjord, Greenland, caused a 200m wave that created seismic signals detected globally for nine days. The landslide involved the collapse of a mountainside and glacial ice, attributed to climate change as melting glaciers destabilize the region. An international team of scientists investigated the event, using seismic data, satellite imagery, and photographs to confirm the landslide's cause and effects. The wave remained trapped in the fjord due to its complex geography, leading to prolonged vibrations. This incident underscores the increasing frequency of such landslides in the Arctic, necessitating further research into their implications.",
