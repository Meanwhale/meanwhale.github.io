    "news_text": "The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has initiated an investigation into Google to determine if it holds excessive power in online search, where it accounts for 90% of web searches. This is the CMA's first investigation under new powers to enforce changes in companies with 'strategic market status.' The CMA aims to ensure fair competition and beneficial outcomes for users and businesses. Google has stated its commitment to working with the CMA. The investigation could lead to changes such as data sharing and increased oversight for publishers. The CMA has nine months to conduct the investigation and can impose rules or interventions to enhance competition.",
