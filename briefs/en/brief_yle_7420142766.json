    "news_text": "The Norwegian aid organization NRC has announced it will stop its operations in almost 20 countries because of the cessation of US subsidies. Currently, the NRC is awaiting payments from the US government, which are crucial for funding. Without a prompt resolution, they may have to suspend essential humanitarian programs by the end of February. The NRC has already halted emergency aid planned for 57,000 people in frontline communities in Ukraine. Last year, over 1.6 million people benefited from NRC assistance funded by US subsidies, which accounted for about one fifth of their total funding.",
