    "news_text": "Cabinet ministers have raised issues with the Treasury regarding proposed cuts to departmental budgets in light of a \u00a340bn funding gap for public services. This gap may necessitate tax increases, leading to what could be the largest tax-raising Budget in a generation when Chancellor Rachel Reeves presents her statement on October 30. Reeves plans to implement a new borrowing rule requiring day-to-day spending to be funded by tax revenues, while the government aims to uphold its manifesto promise of not raising taxes on working individuals. Discussions are ongoing regarding potential extensions of National Insurance to employer pension contributions and possible increases in capital gains tax, alongside speculation about higher fuel taxes due to declining petrol prices.",
