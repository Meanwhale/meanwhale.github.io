    "news_text": "This week, more than 3.5 million Syrian students took their first exams since the fall of Bashar Assad, but they no longer had to answer questions on 'Syrian nationalism' as the transitional education minister, Nazir al-Qadri, annulled the subject. This change has raised alarms among parents and educators about the influence of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) on the curriculum. Al-Qadri, who previously worked in an HTS-controlled area, stated that the changes aim to remove glorification of the Assad regime. However, concerns persist that HTS may impose its ideology on education, and many teachers protested the lack of consultation in these changes. The ongoing war has severely impacted Syria's education system, with millions of children out of school and many schools destroyed or repurposed. UNICEF emphasizes the need for an inclusive curriculum and investment in education to support children's learning.",
