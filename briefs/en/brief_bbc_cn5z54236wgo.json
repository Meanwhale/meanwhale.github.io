    "news_text": "The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is investigating a hotel and conference centre project in Birmingham, funded by Unite the Union, which spent \u00a3112 million of its members' money. The project is now valued at only \u00a329 million, indicating a loss of \u00a383 million. An inquiry led by a KC has uncovered a missing \u00a314 million, raising concerns about financial misconduct. Unite's general secretary, Sharon Graham, is committed to uncovering any wrongdoing. The project, completed in 2020, was intended to be a cost-saving investment for the union. Previous general secretary Len McCluskey supported the project, but the union's executive council feels misled about its value. The investigation follows a separate inquiry into bribery and fraud involving South Wales Police. Unite has stated that Graham faces significant opposition but remains determined to seek the truth and recover lost funds.",
