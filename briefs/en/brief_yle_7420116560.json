    "news_text": "In 2021, the Finnish Eduskunta approved a citizen initiative to protect the domestic ownership of water utilities. However, a recent law proposal permits foreign investors to hold up to 49% ownership in these utilities, which has drawn criticism from several parliament members and experts. Tapio Katko, a researcher from Tampere University, argues that public ownership should be 100% to ensure proper management and maintenance of water services. He expresses concern that allowing significant foreign investment could lead to profit extraction rather than reinvestment in water infrastructure. Katko cites examples from Tallinn, where privatization led to minimal investment and dividend payouts instead. He emphasizes the need to maintain domestic ownership for security and reliability in water services, noting that around 400 water utilities in Finland are municipally owned, with many global examples of privatized water services being returned to public ownership.",
