    "news_text": "Despite the end of the summer tourist season, protests against over-tourism in Spain are intensifying, with demonstrations planned in cities like San Sebastian and Seville. Locals express concerns that tourism is harming their communities, driving up rental prices, and creating precarious jobs. The protests began earlier this year and have included various forms of activism, including hunger strikes. While tourism is vital to Spain's economy, accounting for 13% of GDP, many argue that the current model prioritizes visitors over residents, leading to a loss of community and cultural identity. Local authorities are implementing measures to address these grievances, but activists remain skeptical, insisting that significant changes are necessary to prevent further deterioration of their living conditions.",
