    "news_text": "Saudi Arabia, along with Egypt and Jordan, has rejected the idea of accepting Palestinians, emphasizing their right to their land. This marks a shift in Saudi Arabia&#x27;s diplomatic stance compared to previous years. Analysts suggest that while normalization with Israel remains a priority for the US, it is currently unlikely for Saudi Arabia due to the forced displacement of Palestinians. The situation remains precarious as the ceasefire in Gaza has ended, raising fears of renewed conflict.",
