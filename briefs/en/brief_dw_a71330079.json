    "news_text": "The US Declaration of Independence famously asserts that 'all men are created equal,' but recent court rulings have raised questions about this principle. Notably, Donald Trump has returned to the presidency as the first convicted felon to hold office, facing no constitutional barriers despite his felony conviction related to a hush money scheme. His legal challenges include multiple indictments, but many have been dismissed due to a policy shielding sitting presidents from prosecution. Critics argue this undermines the rule of law and suggests that Trump is above accountability. Legal experts call for a reevaluation of this status quo, emphasizing that no one, including the president, should be above the law.",
