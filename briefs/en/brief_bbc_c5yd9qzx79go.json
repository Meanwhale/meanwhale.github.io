    "news_text": "From April, households in England and Wales will pay an average of \u00a310 more on their monthly water bills, bringing the annual total to \u00a3603. The increase varies by region, with some areas facing hikes as high as 47%. Water companies are investing in infrastructure and providing support for struggling customers, but consumer groups warn that these increases may push more households into debt. The rise is the largest since the water industry's privatization 36 years ago, and while investment is needed, it poses challenges for many customers already facing financial difficulties.",
