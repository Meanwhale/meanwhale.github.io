    "news_text": "Southern Darwin&#x27;s frogs, discovered by Charles Darwin in 1834, have been rescued from a devastating fungal disease affecting amphibians. These frogs carry their tadpoles in their vocal sacs, giving birth through their mouths. Conservationists transported them 7,000 miles to London Zoo to protect the species, which has seen a 90% population decline due to chytridiomycosis. The successful breeding of these frogs symbolizes hope for their future and highlights the importance of conservation efforts.",
