    "news_text": "Canada's political leadership has responded swiftly to US tariffs under President Trump, asserting its position in trade negotiations. Despite claims of diplomatic victories related to fentanyl trafficking, Canada and Mexico have paused negotiations rather than conceding to threats of higher tariffs. Trump's tariff policies are seen as a tool for negotiating trade deficits, yet they risk retaliatory measures from allies. The situation raises questions about the potential rewriting of the global monetary system and the implications for US economic relationships. As Canada prepares to respond to US tariffs, the interconnected nature of the North American auto industry highlights the potential negative impacts of such trade wars.",
