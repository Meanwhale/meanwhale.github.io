    "news_original_title": "BP set to scale back green investments as profits drop sharply",
    "news_text": "BP has announced a major shift in its strategy following a sharp decline in profits, with net income falling to $8.9 billion in 2024 from $13.8 billion the previous year. The company is expected to reduce its renewable energy commitments and increase oil and gas production, mirroring actions taken by competitors like Shell and Equinor. BP&#x27;s previous target of 50GW of renewable capacity by 2030 is likely to be abandoned. Activist shareholders are pushing for more investment in fossil fuels, and there is growing pressure on oil companies to address climate change while they continue to ramp up production.",
