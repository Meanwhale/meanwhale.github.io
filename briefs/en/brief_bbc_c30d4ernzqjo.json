    "news_header": "BP plans to significantly change its strategy as profits fell sharply in 2024, with expectations to reduce renewable projects and increase oil and gas production. The company&#x27;s net income dropped to $8.9 billion from $13.8 billion the previous year, attributed to lower oil prices and refinery profits.",

    "news_text": "BP is likely to abandon its 50GW renewable target set for 2030 and has already scaled back on renewables, including a joint venture for offshore wind assets.
