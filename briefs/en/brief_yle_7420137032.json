    "news_text": "A study conducted at a Czech university involving nearly 36,000 respondents from 28 European countries and Israel found that men generally prefer younger partners, while women prefer slightly older ones. The research revealed that as men age, they increasingly favor younger women, with men in their 40s typically preferring women six years younger and men in their 50s often dating women eight years younger. Conversely, women tend to choose men a few years older than themselves, although women in their 50s and older often seek partners of similar age. The study highlights how partner preferences change with age and was limited to heterosexual couples due to varying laws on gender diversity in different countries.",
