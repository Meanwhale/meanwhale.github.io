    "news_text": "The UK will announce new sanctions against Russia on Monday, coinciding with the third anniversary of Moscow&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy emphasized the need to intensify pressure on Putin&#x27;s regime, stating that the upcoming sanctions package will be the largest since the war began, aimed at crippling Russia&#x27;s military capabilities and diminishing its revenue streams. Since the invasion in 2022, the UK has already sanctioned 1,900 individuals and organizations linked to the Russian government. Lammy highlighted the importance of Europe reinforcing its support for Ukraine, especially as the US takes a leading role in peace negotiations. He also committed to providing \u00a33 billion annually to Ukraine and expressed readiness to deploy UK troops for peacekeeping if needed. UK Prime Minister Keir Stammer is set to meet with US President Trump next week, hoping to bridge the growing divide between Europe and the US regarding the conflict.",
