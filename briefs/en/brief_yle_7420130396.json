    "news_text": "The international project uncovered that the plastic industry is leveraging research funded by an organization to bolster its claims against PFAS restrictions. Hundreds of lobbyists are actively trying to prevent the use of PFAS in the EU, employing tactics reminiscent of the tobacco industry's past defenses. The lobbying efforts surrounding PFAS are unprecedented, overshadowing those of other industries. The project, part of the Forever Lobbying Project, analyzed around 1,200 lobbying arguments from thousands of documents, revealing the industry's claims about PFAS management and safety to be exaggerated or misleading. The environmental and health risks posed by PFAS are significant, yet the industry argues against restrictions, claiming economic repercussions and lack of alternatives. The project highlights the serious public health implications of PFAS and the need for stricter regulations.",
