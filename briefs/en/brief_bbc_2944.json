    "news_text": "Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber, emphasized the importance of waiting a few extra minutes for electric vehicles (EVs) in a recent interview. He stated that Uber is introducing options to promote electric rides and urged governments to enhance support for EV sales, particularly against the backdrop of resistance to Chinese-made EVs. Khosrowshahi believes that high-quality Chinese EVs can help address climate issues. He also advocated for the UK government to adhere to its commitment to end sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. Uber aims for all its journeys to be in zero-emission vehicles by 2040, though the transition is challenging. Currently, most Uber vehicles are not electric, and while some cities have a higher uptake of EVs, overall adoption remains low. Khosrowshahi acknowledged the profitability challenges of electric rides but sees long-term benefits for Uber. He also highlighted the need for targeted government support for high-mileage drivers like Uber drivers. Concerns about pricing and charging infrastructure hinder EV adoption, and Khosrowshahi criticized tariffs on Chinese cars as detrimental to environmental efforts.",
