    "news_text": "Max Prince, upon turning 18, found that his Child Trust Fund, which was supposed to help him start his financial journey, had been reduced to just \u00a312.39 due to annual fees he and his parents were unaware of. The fund, initially worth over \u00a3300, suffered from a \u00a330 annual administration charge that began in 2013, which was not communicated effectively to his family. Columbia Threadneedle, the firm managing the fund, stated they had attempted to inform Max's parents, but the letters were returned unopened due to a change of address. Max's case highlights issues with the management of Child Trust Funds, which were designed to provide financial support to young adults. Investment expert Gavin Oldham criticized the situation and suggested that the firm could reimburse the fees and compensate Max. The average Child Trust Fund is estimated to be around \u00a32,000, with many remaining unclaimed.",
