    "news_text": "A recent study at the University of Turku has developed a promising method using phage biosensors to detect and classify cancer from urine samples. The research, conducted by Juust doctoral students, identified fatal prostate cancer and classified metastatic cancer. This innovative approach may serve as an alternative to current diagnostic methods. Future work will refine the method and explore its applicability to various diseases with broader patient data.",
