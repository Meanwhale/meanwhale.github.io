    "news_text": "A recent study at the University of Turku has developed a promising method using phage biosensors to detect and classify cancer from urine samples. The doctoral research by Vilmeiina focused on creating these biosensors, which utilize bacterial viruses to identify fatal prostate cancer and classify metastatic cancer. This innovative approach may serve as an alternative to current diagnostic methods and early screening. The research involved collaboration with Aqsens Health Ltd, TYKS, and HUS, and future work will refine the method and explore its applicability for various disease classifications.",
