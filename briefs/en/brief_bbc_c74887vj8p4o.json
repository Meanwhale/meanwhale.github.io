    "news_header": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves will not announce new freeports in the upcoming Budget, contrary to previous government statements. Instead, she will confirm new customs sites within existing freeports.",
    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves will not unveil five new freeports as previously announced, but will outline plans for new customs sites within existing freeports. This decision follows a communication error from the government, which caused confusion among businesses and officials. The new customs sites will be designated in Inverness and the Humber, making the Humber site operational for tax reliefs. Reeves will also announce plans for an investment zone in the East Midlands. The mishap has raised concerns about government operations and could impact business confidence, with critics arguing that freeports may not create new jobs but merely shift them around.",
