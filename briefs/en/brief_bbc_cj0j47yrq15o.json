    "news_text": "Zara, a 20-something woman from the US with Somali heritage, became addicted to TikTok's Big Tribal Game, where influencers engage in verbal battles representing their clans. She spent over $7,000, initially for clan pride, but later faced harassment from male influencers, including threats of sharing manipulated images. Despite reporting to TikTok, she felt unsupported. The platform has since banned the offending accounts. The game raises concerns about clannism and toxic online behavior, with influencers often creating an illusion of wealth while many in Somalia struggle economically.",
