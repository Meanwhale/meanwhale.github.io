    "news_text": "The UK government has committed nearly \u00a322 billion to Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) technology, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capturing and storing carbon dioxide produced by industry. However, MPs have expressed concerns that the financial impact on consumers and businesses has not been adequately assessed, as three-quarters of the funding will come from consumer bills. While the government argues that CCUS is essential for achieving climate goals, critics highlight the lack of proven success in the UK and the need for profit-sharing mechanisms in future contracts. The government anticipates that this investment will attract private sector funding and create jobs, but questions remain about the sustainability of the funding model.",
