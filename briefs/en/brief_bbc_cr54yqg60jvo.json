    "news_text": "Donald Trump has publicly condemned US District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, labeling her 'the most evil person' after she released over 1,800 pages of evidence in the election conspiracy case against him. Trump argued that her refusal to delay the release of evidence until after the upcoming election constituted 'election interference.' Judge Chutkan countered that withholding information could also be seen as interference. The released documents largely reiterate previously available information, including parts of former Vice-President Mike Pence's biography. The case revolves around Trump's alleged conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results, particularly in relation to the January 6 Capitol riot. Trump has faced multiple legal challenges, including a conviction on felony counts related to a hush-money payment.",
