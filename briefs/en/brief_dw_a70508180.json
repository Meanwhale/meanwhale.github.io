    "news_text": "Boeing announced on Tuesday its intention to raise up to $25 billion over the next three years through new share issuances and agreements with lenders to support its struggling balance sheet after years of losses exceeding $25 billion. This announcement coincides with a prolonged strike by factory workers demanding a 40% salary increase over four years, which has halted production of key aircraft models. Despite an offer to raise wages by 30% being rejected by union negotiators, Boeing's stock rose by 2% following the funding announcement. The company has also entered a $10 billion credit agreement to improve short-term liquidity, which Fitch Ratings noted would enhance financial flexibility and reduce downgrade risks. The strike, now in its second month, has compounded Boeing's financial challenges, delaying the delivery of its 777X jetliner to 2026.",
