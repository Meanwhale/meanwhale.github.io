    "news_text": "Dr. Ravi Kumar, a 53-year-old NHS consultant, fell victim to a scam that resulted in a loss of \u00a339,000 when he was tricked into transferring money to his Revolut account. After receiving calls from individuals claiming to be from American Express and Barclays, he was convinced to create virtual debit cards, which allowed the scammers to access his funds without notifications. Despite his attempts to seek a refund from Revolut, he was denied due to having authorized the transactions. Kumar, along with over 100 others, expressed dissatisfaction with Revolut's handling of fraud cases. The company, which has a broad range of financial features, lacks an emergency contact number for account freezing, raising concerns about security. Other victims, like Lynne Elms, faced similar issues, losing significant amounts of money and experiencing frustration with Revolut's customer service. The ongoing investigations and complaints highlight the challenges customers face in recovering lost funds and the emotional toll of such scams.",
