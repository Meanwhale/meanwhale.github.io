    "news_text": "The debt crisis in Africa has worsened due to rising energy and food import costs, falling global raw material prices, wars, climate change, and poor governance. Zambia declared insolvency during the COVID-19 crisis, with a national debt reaching 129% of GDP in 2020, largely due to high foreign loans and the pandemic's impact. Similarly, Ghana suspended debt payments in December 2022, negotiating a historic $13 billion debt relief deal in October 2024. Other African nations like Chad and Ethiopia are also seeking assistance from international financial institutions. The IMF and World Bank's support often comes with structural adjustment programs that can lead to social unrest. The study by Eckhardt Bode emphasizes the need for multilateral solutions, highlighting the conflicting interests of Western and Chinese creditors, which complicates debt relief efforts. Additionally, negative media portrayals of Africa contribute to higher borrowing costs, costing the continent billions annually. Calls for a shift in international debt relief policies are urgent, but a clear plan is lacking. The World Bank has identified 26 countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, as deeply indebted, with IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva advocating for greater representation for Africa in international financial institutions.",
