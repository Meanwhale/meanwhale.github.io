    "news_header": "The debt crisis in Africa is exacerbated by rising costs, climate change, and governance issues, with countries like Zambia and Ghana facing severe financial challenges and seeking debt relief.",
    "news_text": "The debt situation in Africa has worsened due to rising energy and food import costs, falling raw material prices, wars, climate change, and poor governance. Zambia declared bankruptcy during the COVID-19 crisis, facing a national debt of 129% of GDP in 2020, primarily due to high costs and foreign loans, particularly from China. Similarly, Ghana suspended debt payments in December 2022 and negotiated a historic $13 billion debt relief deal in October 2024. Other countries like Chad, Ethiopia, and Kenya are also seeking assistance from international financial institutions. The IMF's support often comes with structural adjustment programs that can lead to social unrest. The need for multilateral solutions is urgent, especially with the conflicting interests of Western nations and China in lending practices. Negative media portrayals of African countries contribute to higher borrowing costs, with a study indicating that this bias costs African borrowers billions annually. Experts call for a shift in international debt relief policies and greater representation for Africa in financial institutions, while cautioning against further borrowing to avoid over-indebtedness.",
