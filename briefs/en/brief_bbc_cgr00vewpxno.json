    "news_text": "A conflict has erupted between the UK's financial watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), and former Conservative Chancellor Jeremy Hunt over a report addressing a \u00a322bn 'black hole' in public finances that Labour claims to have inherited. As Labour prepares to present its first Budget in nearly 15 years, Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to propose tax increases to cover the alleged shortfall. Hunt argues that the OBR's report, which will be released on the same day as the Budget, will unfairly criticize his party and support Labour's tax hikes. He has expressed concerns about the timing of the report, suggesting it undermines political impartiality. The OBR, however, maintains that the review focuses on its relationship with the Treasury and not on the actions of individual ministers, asserting that it was not necessary to share the report with Hunt beforehand.",
