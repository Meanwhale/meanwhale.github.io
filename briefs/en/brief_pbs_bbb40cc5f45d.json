    "news_text": "Hamas released the bodies of four Israeli hostages, including a mother and her two children, who were presumed dead after the October 7 attack. The remains were identified as Shiri Bibas and her children, Ariel and Kfir, along with Oded Lifshitz. Israeli President Isaac Herzog expressed national grief and sought forgiveness for failing to protect them. The release serves as a grim reminder of those who died in captivity amid ongoing negotiations for a ceasefire. While 24 hostages have been released recently, the situation remains tense as Hamas plans to release more hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The conflict has resulted in significant casualties and destruction in Gaza.",
