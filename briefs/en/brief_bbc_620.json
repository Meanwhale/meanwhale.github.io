    "news_text": "Sellafield, located in Cumbria, is the UK's primary nuclear waste storage site, housing most of the country's radioactive materials, including a significant stockpile of plutonium. The site operates 24/7 with over 11,000 staff and incurs costs exceeding \u00a32 billion annually. However, concerns have arisen regarding its security and structural integrity, particularly due to a leaking storage silo and recent cyber-security breaches. Experts emphasize the urgent need for a new permanent storage solution, ideally involving geological disposal facilities (GDF) deep underground. Communities are being assessed for potential sites, with financial incentives offered for participation. The process is complex and ongoing, with the earliest possible waste disposal not expected until the 2050s. Meanwhile, Sellafield continues to manage and store nuclear waste, highlighting the legacy and challenges of the UK's nuclear energy history.",
