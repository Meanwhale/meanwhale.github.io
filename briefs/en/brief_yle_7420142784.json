    "news_text": "In the United States, Senate Democrats have opened a web portal for government employees and public officials to report irregularities, abuse of power, and threats to public security. The portal requires users to provide their name, organization, email, and the nature of their complaint. Critics argue that many of President Donald Trump&#x27;s initiatives exceed his executive powers. With Republicans controlling both the Senate and the House of Representatives, Congressional Democrats have limited means to challenge the new president.",
