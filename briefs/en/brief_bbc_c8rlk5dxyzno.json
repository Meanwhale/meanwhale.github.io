    "news_text": "Striking Boeing workers are set to vote on a new offer from the company, which includes a 38% pay increase over the next four years and a $12,000 bonus if an agreement is reached. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) union, representing over 30,000 workers, supports the offer and plans to hold a vote on November 4. The strike, which began on September 13, has significantly slowed production and has cost Boeing nearly $10 billion. The company is also facing financial challenges, reporting $4 billion in operating losses for the last quarter and planning to lay off around 17,000 workers.",
