    "news_text": "As a new presidential administration approaches, discussions about potential policy changes create uncertainty, particularly in economic and trade policies. Historical data shows that while economic policy uncertainty tends to impact markets significantly, trade policy uncertainty has a limited effect. The VIX index indicates that markets react more to economic policy uncertainty, especially during recessions, while trade policy fluctuations have not correlated strongly with market performance.",
