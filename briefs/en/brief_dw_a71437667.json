    "news_text": "German businesses are calling for significant reforms from the next government, including lower energy costs, reduced taxes, and less bureaucracy, as the economy faces a downturn with rising unemployment and decreased competitiveness. The Confederation of German Employers' Associations highlights the challenges posed by rising production costs and the need for a more attractive business environment. An upcoming demonstration aims to raise awareness of these issues, as businesses express concern over offshoring and the potential impact of global trade dynamics, particularly with the US. The next government will need to navigate financial constraints while addressing these demands.",
