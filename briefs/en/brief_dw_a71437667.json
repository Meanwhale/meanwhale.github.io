    "news_text": "German businesses are calling for significant reforms from the next government, including lower energy costs, reduced taxes, and less bureaucracy, as the economy faces challenges like rising unemployment and decreased competitiveness. The Confederation of German Employers' Associations highlights that the economy is shrinking and that regulations have increased, making Germany less attractive for investment. A coalition of economic associations plans a nationwide action to address these issues, emphasizing the need for improved infrastructure and support for rural regions. With the upcoming elections, the political landscape is uncertain, and businesses are concerned about the impact of global trade dynamics, especially with the US under Trump's leadership.",
