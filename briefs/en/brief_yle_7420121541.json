This significant reduction is attributed to decreased coal usage and increased renewable energy sources, which now account for 24% of energy in Europe. By 2030, emissions are expected to fall to 4% of 1990 levels, with a target of a 55% reduction in the EU if new methods to cut emissions are not found.",
