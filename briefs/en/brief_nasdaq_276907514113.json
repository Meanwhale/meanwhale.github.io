    "news_text": "Billionaire investor Bill Ackman has reiterated his positive outlook on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, suggesting they are on the verge of a pivotal moment that could yield substantial returns for investors. His optimism is linked to potential regulatory changes under a second Trump administration, which he believes could facilitate the end of the GSEs' conservatorship. Despite their recovery since the 2008 financial crisis, both entities remain under government control. Ackman estimates that a successful exit from conservatorship could generate $300 billion in profits for the government. However, he acknowledges the risks involved, including regulatory hurdles and market conditions, urging investors to only risk what they can afford to lose.",
