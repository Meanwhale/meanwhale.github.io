    "news_text": "During a Donald Trump rally at Madison Square Garden, comedian Tony Hinchcliffe referred to Puerto Rico as a 'floating island of garbage,' igniting outrage from both Republicans and Democrats who accused him of racism. Hinchcliffe's comments, which also included other racially insensitive jokes, drew criticism from various political figures, including Trump adviser distancing the former president from the remarks and Kamala Harris, who was endorsed by Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny. The controversy highlighted ongoing tensions surrounding Puerto Rican identity and representation, especially in light of the island's political status and recent natural disasters. Hinchcliffe later defended his material, claiming it was meant as humor, while others, including Congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar, condemned his comments as not reflective of GOP values. The incident occurred amidst a backdrop of significant political campaigning, with Harris unveiling policies aimed at supporting Puerto Rico.",
