    "news_text": "During a Donald Trump rally at Madison Square Garden, comedian Tony Hinchcliffe referred to Puerto Rico as a 'floating island of garbage', igniting outrage from both Republicans and Democrats who accused him of racism. Hinchcliffe's comments, which included other racially charged jokes, drew criticism from figures like Congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar and Senator Rick Scott, who emphasized the contributions of Puerto Ricans. The controversy coincided with Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny endorsing Kamala Harris for president, highlighting the political tensions surrounding the event. Hinchcliffe defended his material, claiming it was meant as humor, while others, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, expressed their disapproval. The rally also featured other controversial remarks from Trump\u2019s supporters, further fueling the political discourse as the election approached.",
