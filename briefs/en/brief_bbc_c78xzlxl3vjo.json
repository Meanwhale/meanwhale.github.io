    "news_text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with US President Donald Trump at the White House on February 4, making him the first foreign leader invited during Trump's second term. The meeting is confirmed to occur early next week, although the exact time is not yet finalized. This meeting follows a six-week ceasefire in Gaza, established after a deal between Israel and Hamas. Trump has claimed credit for facilitating the ceasefire and hostage release. Additionally, Trump has proposed that Egypt and Jordan accept Palestinians from Gaza, a suggestion that has been met with condemnation from both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, as well as rejection from Jordan and Egypt. The ceasefire follows a violent conflict that began on October 7, 2023, resulting in significant casualties on both sides.",
