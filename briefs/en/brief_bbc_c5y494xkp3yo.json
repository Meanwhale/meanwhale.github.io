    "news_original_title": "The asteroid hits and near-misses you never hear about",
    "news_text": "Asteroid 2024 YR4 has been in the news due to fluctuating estimates of its impact risk, now at 0.28% for 2032, down from 3.1%. It&#x27;s more likely to hit the Moon, with a 1% chance. Many other asteroids pass close to Earth regularly, and while most are harmless, they provide valuable insights into our solar system&#x27;s history. Monitoring of near-Earth objects has improved significantly since the late 20th century. The potential impact of a large asteroid could be catastrophic, prompting advances in planetary defense strategies. NASA and the European Space Agency are developing technologies to deflect dangerous asteroids. Scientists are also excited about the possibility of studying asteroid impacts, especially if YR4 hits the Moon, as it could provide real-world data to enhance our understanding of such events. Overall, the risk of asteroid impacts remains a concern, and monitoring efforts continue to improve.",
