    "news_text": "The Prime Minister and Chancellor are exploring modifications to inheritance tax to boost government revenue, with details expected in the October 30 Budget. Currently, inheritance tax is levied at 40% on estates exceeding a \u00a3325,000 threshold, generating approximately \u00a37 billion annually. Presently, only about 4% of estates are subject to this tax, but predictions suggest this could rise to 7% by 2032. Various exemptions exist, including transfers to spouses, charities, and certain agricultural properties. Changes may involve revising exemptions and rules regarding gifts made during a person's lifetime.",
