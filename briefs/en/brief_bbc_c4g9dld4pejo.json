    "news_text": "Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the exiled opposition leader, describes the upcoming elections in Belarus as a sham and a military-style operation aimed at maintaining power for Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled for three decades with increasing authoritarianism. Despite the regime's tight controls and lack of independent observers, Tikhanovskaya urges Belarusians to reject the elections and remain safe until a real opportunity for change arises. The atmosphere of fear and repression has silenced opposition voices, with many activists imprisoned or in exile. Tikhanovskaya emphasizes the ongoing trauma from the protests of 2020 and the need for the international community to recognize the illegitimacy of Lukashenko's regime.",
