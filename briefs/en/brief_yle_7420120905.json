    "news_text": "Terrafame, a Finnish state-owned chemical and mining company, is experiencing financial difficulties as electric car sales fall short of expectations. The company will initiate negotiations affecting all personnel for economic reasons, potentially leading to a workforce reduction of up to 75 positions. As of September, Terrafame employed 826 people, with a total of around 1,900 employees. The company reported a loss of EUR 14.3 million from July to September, an improvement from EUR 20.3 million in the previous quarter. The economic downturn is attributed to slower electrification in transport and lower market prices for metals and battery chemicals. Additionally, Terrafame is under financial strain due to a significant investment in a new project, the largest in its history. To address these challenges, Terrafame has launched a profitability program aimed at saving EUR 10 million annually, although change negotiations are still necessary. The Finnish state, through its ownership of 64.4%, is the main stakeholder in Terrafame.",
