    "news_text": "The financial situation of Meyer Werft shipyard has deteriorated, revealing a need for an additional EUR 185 million just weeks after a state rescue package was implemented. The shipyard, which was saved last autumn with taxpayer money and guarantees amounting to billions, is in worse shape than anticipated. The Land of Lower Saxony only discovered the financial issues in October, and the German Bundestag Committee on Budgets will address these concerns. The budget approval of EUR 200 million is expected to help save the shipyard, with the Meyer family becoming a minority owner while the state holds around 80% ownership.",
