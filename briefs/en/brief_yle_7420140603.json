    "news_text": "There is disagreement among experts in Finland regarding whether there is a shortage of doctors or if health issues stem from other factors. The Economic Policy Review Council has proposed ways to alleviate the doctor shortage, while health experts discuss the implications of these proposals. Finland has fewer doctors per capita compared to other Nordic and EU countries, and although the government has increased training places, there are still concerns about regional disparities and the adequacy of training. Experts highlight issues such as the uneven distribution of doctors, the impact of wage development, and the need for reforms to address inequalities in healthcare access. Additionally, there are discussions about the potential for using technology and artificial intelligence to improve healthcare delivery.",
