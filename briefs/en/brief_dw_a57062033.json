    "news_text": "The article explores the debate surrounding gender and sex, highlighting the traditional binary view that equates gender with biological sex. It references statements from political figures like Donald Trump and Friedrich Merz, who support the idea of only two genders. However, it contrasts this with the scientific consensus that recognizes sex as a spectrum, with variations in chromosomes and hormonal influences. The piece also discusses intersex individuals and the evolving understanding of gender identity, emphasizing that sex characteristics are not strictly binary and that both biology and environment play significant roles.",
