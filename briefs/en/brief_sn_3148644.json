    "news_text": "Research indicates that Australopithecus africanus, an early human ancestor, primarily consumed a vegetarian diet rather than a meat-rich one. Analyzing the nitrogen ratios in fossilized teeth from individuals around 3.5 million years old reveals that while their diet varied, it was not heavily reliant on mammalian meat. This suggests that adaptations such as bipedalism and shorter snouts may have occurred before the shift to a protein-rich diet, although occasional consumption of meat or termites may have happened.",
