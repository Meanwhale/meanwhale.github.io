    "news_text": "The UK government will announce five new freeports and a new investment zone in the upcoming Budget to stimulate economic growth and job creation. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer highlighted that while freeports, which are low tax zones near ports and airports, have been effective, they require better local business and political involvement. He acknowledged that freeports were a Conservative policy but stressed the need for enhancements to ensure they contribute positively to local economies. Critics argue that freeports may merely shift jobs rather than create new ones. The government claims that freeports have attracted significant investment and created thousands of jobs, despite concerns about their effectiveness and links to organized crime.",
