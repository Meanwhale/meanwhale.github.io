    "news_header": "Kenya is becoming increasingly hostile for refugees, particularly after the abduction and deportation of Turkish refugees at the request of the Turkish government, raising concerns about the country's commitment to protecting those fleeing persecution.",
    "news_text": "Once a refuge for those escaping political persecution and war, Kenya is now seen as increasingly dangerous for refugees. Recent abductions of Turkish refugees, recognized by the UN, have drawn criticism as the Kenyan government deported them at Turkey's request, violating the principle of 'non-refoulement.' Rights groups express concern over Kenya's deteriorating reputation and its collaboration with foreign security forces in apprehending refugees. The situation has led to fears among many refugees, prompting some to seek protection from NGOs. The deportation of the Turkish nationals, linked to the Gulen movement, has raised alarms about the safety of all refugees in Kenya.",
