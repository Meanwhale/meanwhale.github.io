    "news_text": "This Halloween, community scientists are exploring the biofluorescence of scorpions, millipedes, and other creatures using ultraviolet light. Recent findings have documented at least 15 new examples of biofluorescence, including a Japanese beetle with a glowing mouth and a ball python with orange patterns. The phenomenon occurs when organisms absorb UV light and emit it at lower energy. The initiative, led by biologist Courtney Whitcher, encourages public participation in documenting fluorescence through a dedicated website, aiming to inspire curiosity about the natural world.",
