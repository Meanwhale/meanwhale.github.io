    "news_text": "The expansion of wind power in Europe, particularly in Finland, presents both opportunities and challenges. While wind energy is crucial for the green transition, its construction often leads to environmental degradation, including deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. Current regulations are inadequate, allowing wind farms to be built close to residential areas without proper oversight. Furthermore, the financial aspects of wind power projects can lead to complications, such as the potential burden of decommissioning costs falling on landowners or municipalities. The lack of clear rules has turned Finland into a &#x27;Wild West&#x27; for wind energy, where profits may not benefit the local economy. To ensure wind power contributes positively, national guidelines are essential.",
