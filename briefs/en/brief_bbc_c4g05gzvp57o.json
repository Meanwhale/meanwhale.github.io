    "news_text": "Will Rogers State Beach, famous from &#x27;Baywatch&#x27;, is now a hazardous waste site following severe wildfires. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is rapidly cleaning up approximately 4.5 million tonnes of debris, including dangerous burned electric vehicle batteries. Protests have arisen due to the sorting of hazardous materials near the coast, with concerns about ocean safety for swimming and surfing. The EPA aims to complete the cleanup by February 25, following an executive order from President Trump. Local surfers and environmentalists express worry over the impact on water quality and the environment, as initial tests show better results than expected but still advise caution. The scale of the cleanup is unprecedented, with many beaches closed and ongoing monitoring of water and soil for contaminants. The community is anxious about when it will be safe to return to the ocean.",
