    "news_text": "Donald Trump has shown interest in the US acquiring Greenland, claiming it is necessary for national security. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen previously dismissed the idea as absurd, but now emphasizes cooperation with the US. The geopolitical implications are significant, with European leaders concerned about potential annexation similar to Russia's actions in Ukraine. Greenland's Prime Minister Mute Egede supports independence but wants to avoid dependence on other nations. The island's resources and strategic location are of interest to the US, Russia, and China. Historically, the US has had military presence in Greenland, and while the idea of purchasing the territory has precedent, Greenland's leadership firmly rejects the notion of being for sale.",
