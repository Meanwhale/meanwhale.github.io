    "news_text": "Analyzing 630,000 recordings from 22 studies across four countries, researchers found that women aged 25-65 speak more than men, with an average difference of 1,073 words per day. The gender gap is largest in early adulthood and mid-age. The decline in overall word usage from 2005 to 2018, from 16,000 to 13,000 words daily, may be linked to increased digital communication.",
