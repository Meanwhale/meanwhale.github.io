    "news_text": "The September inflation figure, which is 1.7%, will influence the rise in benefits and state pensions, as well as interest rates and shop prices. This comes just before the government's first Budget, where difficult decisions on welfare and tax are expected. Benefits such as universal credit and disability payments will likely increase in line with inflation, but the rise is smaller than last year. The state pension will rise by 4.1% due to earnings growth, but many pensioners will lose winter fuel payments. Lower inflation may lead to interest rate cuts, benefiting borrowers but potentially harming savers. Concerns remain about the upcoming Budget, with reports of potential tax rises and spending cuts totaling \u00a340bn.",
