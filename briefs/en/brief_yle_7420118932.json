    "news_text": "On Friday, Cuba faced a total power outage after a failure at the Antonio Guiteras power plant, affecting the entire island. While major hospitals in Havana were among the first to regain power, most of the 10 million residents remained without electricity into Saturday. The state electricity company, UNE, is working to bring five oil-fired power plants online to restore power to more areas. The country has been experiencing widespread blackouts, with some provinces facing outages of up to 20 hours, attributed to an energy emergency declared by Prime Minister Manuel Marrero and exacerbated by a fuel shortage from Hurricane Milton.",
