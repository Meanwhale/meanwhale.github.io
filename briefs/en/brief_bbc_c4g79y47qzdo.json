    "news_header": "The government is proposing to ease pension scheme restrictions to boost economic growth, as many defined benefit schemes have surplus funds that are currently trapped.",
    "news_text": "The government aims to relax restrictions on pension scheme management to stimulate economic growth, citing a \u00a3160bn surplus in defined benefit schemes. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized that growth is the government's top priority, while Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted the need for new projects to enhance the economy. Although there are concerns about the risks of redeploying surplus funds, the Pensions Regulator supports efforts to safely release these funds for member benefits or broader economic investment. Critics, however, doubt the effectiveness of these reforms and stress the need for guarantees to protect workers' pensions.",
