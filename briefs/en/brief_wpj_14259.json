    "news_text": "New data from CoreLogic indicates that around 500,000 residential properties in the greater Tampa Bay and Sarasota metro areas are at risk of storm surge flooding due to Hurricane Milton, with an estimated reconstruction cost value (RCV) of $123 billion if it makes landfall as a Category 3 storm. If the hurricane weakens to a Category 1, the number of homes at risk could decrease to 225,000 with an RCV of $55 billion. Conversely, if it strengthens to a Category 4, up to 700,000 homes could be affected, totaling an RCV of $174 billion. The storm's intensity is expected to fluctuate in the next 24 hours, potentially increasing its size and exposure to coastal areas. Changes in landfall location could significantly impact damage levels, with a direct hit on Tampa Bay causing the most severe effects. Additionally, commercial properties could face an extra $50 billion in reconstruction costs.",
