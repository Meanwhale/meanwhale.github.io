    "news_text": "Aleksandra Tomanic highlights the difficulties in inviting people from Kosovo to events in Bosnia-Herzegovina due to cumbersome visa requirements, despite agreements made in 2022 to ease travel and recognition of ID cards and qualifications. The Berlin Process, launched in 2014 to support Western Balkan countries' EU integration, has expanded but has seen limited tangible results and stalled implementation of agreements. While there are positive outcomes like the RYCO youth exchange program and significant EU investment, unresolved conflicts, particularly between Serbia and Kosovo, continue to hinder progress. As the 10th anniversary of the Berlin Process approaches, discussions focus on further integration and addressing geopolitical concerns in the region.",
