    "news_original_title": "The moon\u2019s two grand canyons formed in less than 10 minutes",
    "news_text": "A recent study indicates that two grand canyons on the moon, Vallis Schr\u00f6dinger and Vallis Planck, were formed by a massive impact near the lunar south pole 3.8 billion years ago. The impact sent rocks flying into the lunar surface, creating the canyons in less than 10 minutes. The canyons, which are significantly larger than the Grand Canyon, provide opportunities for scientists to explore ancient lunar rocks and better understand the moon's history. However, the proximity of the Schr\u00f6dinger basin to NASA's Artemis landing site raises concerns about the potential burial of these ancient rocks.",
