    "news_header": "Egypt and Ethiopia attended a BRICS summit for the first time as the group expands its membership, which now includes several new countries. The summit focused on financial cooperation and alternatives to Western payment systems, with discussions on how African nations can benefit from joining BRICS.",
    "news_text": "The recent BRICS summit marked the first participation of Egypt and Ethiopia following the group's expansion to include Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasized shared values among member countries and the need for a new democratic global order. The summit facilitated discussions on enhancing financial cooperation and creating alternatives to Western payment systems. Analysts suggest that the expansion of BRICS could help African nations reposition themselves globally, with countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo encouraged to join for economic benefits. While the relationship with BRICS offers opportunities, there are concerns about potential risks, such as unfavorable trade deals that could harm local production. Some experts believe that African countries can maintain ties with both BRICS and Western nations simultaneously.",
