    "news_text": "Energy prices and rents are increasing significantly, leading many young adults in the UK to continue living with their parents. The proportion of 25 to 34-year-olds living at home has risen by over a third in nearly two decades. Men are more likely to stay with their parents than women. Financial pressures, exacerbated by the pandemic, have made it difficult for young adults to afford independent living. Many express frustration over the lack of affordable housing, and even those who have moved out often require financial assistance from their parents to buy their own homes.",
