    "news_text": "Mike Jeffries, the former CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch, has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking and interstate prostitution in a New York federal court. Alongside him, his alleged middleman James Jacobson also entered a not guilty plea. Jeffries' partner, Matthew Smith, faces similar charges and is expected to appear in court later. Federal prosecutors allege that the men engaged in violent and exploitative sexual acts, using force and coercion. The FBI's investigation was prompted by a BBC report detailing accusations from multiple men who claimed abuse at events hosted by Jeffries and Smith. Jeffries is under house arrest, having posted a $10 million bond secured by his property. If convicted, the men could face severe prison sentences. Jeffries, who served as CEO from 1992 to 2014, is scheduled for another court appearance on December 12.",
