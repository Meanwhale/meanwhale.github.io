    "news_text": "Navarro, a male Iberian lynx, is part of a successful breeding program that has increased the population of this rare species from fewer than 100 to over 2,000 in Spain and Portugal. The decline was caused by habitat loss, road fatalities, and a decrease in prey. Conservation efforts, including a breeding center in Portugal, have helped prepare lynxes for life in the wild. While the program has been successful, challenges remain, including conflicts with local farmers and road deaths. The goal is to reach a population of 5,000-6,000 by 2035.",
