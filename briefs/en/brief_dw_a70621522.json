    "news_text": "Chad's presidency reported that approximately 40 soldiers were killed in an overnight assault on a military base in the Lac region, which borders Nigeria. President Mahamat Idriss Deby visited the site and ordered a military operation to pursue the attackers. While the government did not confirm the assailants' identity, local security sources indicated that Boko Haram was responsible. The attackers reportedly took control of the base, stole weapons, and burned vehicles before retreating. The region has faced repeated insurgent attacks, and Chad has been a key ally in the fight against Islamist terrorism in the Sahel, especially as neighboring countries shift their military alliances. The area has seen significant displacement due to violence, with over 220,000 people affected by armed group attacks.",
