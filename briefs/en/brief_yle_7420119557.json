    "news_text": "Bolt drivers in Finland are expressing dissatisfaction with the platform's pricing and reward structure, which has seen a decrease in driver compensation and an increase in the mediation fee from 15% to 23%. Many drivers report that their earnings barely cover their vehicle costs, with a minimum fare of 6.50 euros often leaving them with little profit after expenses like VAT and fuel. Over 70 drivers gathered in Helsinki to advocate for higher prices and lower fees, highlighting the financial strain of fuel costs, insurance, and car loans. The uncertainty of dynamic pricing further complicates their situation, as drivers cannot predict their earnings before accepting rides. Some drivers are calling for government intervention, expressing concerns about competition from other ride-sharing services like Uber and Yango.",
