    "news_text": "Karen, a 60-year-old woman from Sheffield, struggled with significant debts after a relationship ended and felt isolated. While visiting a food bank, she was referred to Sheffield Christians Against Poverty (CAP), which assisted her in applying for a Debt Relief Order at no cost, following the removal of a \u00a390 fee. This change led to a surge in applications. Karen expressed relief at becoming debt-free and learned budgeting skills. The Financial Inclusion Commission reported rising borrowing due to increased living costs, while debt advice services noted a spike in buy now, pay later debts. Morgan, a 25-year-old from Liverpool, shared his experience of falling into debt through buy now, pay later loans and emphasized the need for caution. The government plans to regulate this sector by 2025.",
