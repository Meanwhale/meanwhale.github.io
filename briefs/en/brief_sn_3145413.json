    "news_text": "Ne\u2019Kiya Jackson and Calcea Johnson, two high school classmates, recently published 10 new trigonometric proofs of the Pythagorean theorem in the American Mathematical Monthly, defying a belief that such proofs were impossible for over 2,000 years. Their work, developed while they were seniors at St. Mary\u2019s Academy in New Orleans, showcases their creativity and determination. Despite the challenges of publishing in a peer-reviewed journal while starting college, they succeeded in presenting their findings, which include innovative approaches to proving the theorem. Their publication aims to inspire other students and contribute to ongoing mathematical discussions.",
