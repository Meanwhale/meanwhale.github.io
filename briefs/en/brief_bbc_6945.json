    "news_text": "The Hera spacecraft, launched by the European Space Agency from Cape Canaveral, is en route to the asteroid Dimorphos, which NASA successfully redirected in 2022. This mission, part of an international effort to prevent dangerous asteroid impacts, will investigate the effects of NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) on Dimorphos, a small moon in a binary system with Didymos. Scheduled to arrive in December 2026, Hera will analyze the impact crater and the asteroid's composition to improve future interception strategies. While scientists do not currently believe Earth is at risk of a catastrophic asteroid impact, they aim to develop methods to mitigate potential damage from smaller asteroids that are harder to detect.",
