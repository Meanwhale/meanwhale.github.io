    "news_text": "Helsinki's Mayor Juhana Vartianen presented a budget that allows for increased funding across all sectors without cuts, maintaining free health center visits despite a legal fee of up to \u20ac23. The budget includes a 6.2% increase in operating expenses, totaling \u20ac3.3 billion, excluding social and health costs. The city plans to continue its investment program, but future financial constraints may delay projects like school construction and repairs. The current mayor will not seek re-election, leading to potential changes in future budget priorities.",
