    "news_text": "HSBC's quarterly profits rose by 10% to $8.5bn, surpassing analysts' expectations, as the bank initiates a significant restructuring under new CEO Georges Elhedery. The firm will split its operations into eastern and western markets due to geopolitical tensions and cost-cutting needs. Elhedery stated that the implementation of these plans will start immediately, with more details to be shared in February. HSBC also announced a $3bn share buyback and the expected sale of its Argentinian business by year-end. The bank has shifted its focus towards Asia and appointed Pam Kaur as its first female finance chief. Elhedery took over from Noel Quinn in September during a pivotal time for the bank.",
