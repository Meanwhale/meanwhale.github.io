    "news_original_title": "Top prosecutor resigns after being told to drop case against NYC mayor Eric Adams",
    "news_text": "Adams is accused of accepting over $100,000 in gifts from Turkish citizens in exchange for favors, which he denies. The case was initiated by Biden-appointed officials, but a Trump appointee ordered its dismissal, citing it restricted Adams&#x27; ability to address immigration and crime. Sassoon&#x27;s refusal led to her resignation and the resignation of other prosecutors, amid concerns over political influence in the justice system.",
