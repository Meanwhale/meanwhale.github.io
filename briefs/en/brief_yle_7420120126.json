    "news_text": "In a recent discussion, Peter Trubowitz highlighted the implications of Donald Trump's possible re-election for U.S.-Europe relations, suggesting it could signify a fundamental shift in American values. Concerns revolve around Trump's rhetoric on migration, which echoes Nazi-era language, and his past relationships with authoritarian leaders. European leaders express a preference for a more stable and predictable U.S. under Kamala Harris. The rise of populist and extremist parties in Europe, fueled by anti-migration sentiments, reflects a growing divergence in values. Additionally, there are fears about changes in U.S. military support for Ukraine and NATO commitments if Trump returns to power. Thomas Gomart emphasized the need for European countries to enhance their own defense capabilities independent of U.S. support.",
