    "news_text": "The decline in species in Europe may lead to a loss of plants, with Finnish experts not overly concerned. A study indicates that one-tenth of Europe's vegetables are at risk due to natural disasters affecting their seeds. Animals, including birds and insects, play a crucial role in spreading plant seeds, but their decline complicates plant habitat expansion. A database of over 5,000 plant-animal pairs shows that many species are threatened. Notably, two declining bird species are significant for seed dispersal. Despite the decline, some species are still abundant, making it difficult to assess the overall impact on seed distribution.",
