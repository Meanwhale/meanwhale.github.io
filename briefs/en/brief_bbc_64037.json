    "news_text": "The construction of Britain's first new nuclear power station in a generation at Hinkley Point C has raised urgent concerns about the impact on local fish populations. EDF, the company behind the project, estimates that 44 tonnes of fish will be killed annually due to the sea-water cooling system. While EDF claims this is a small fraction compared to local fishing catches, conservationists argue that it will significantly harm fish stocks, particularly salmon. Engineers have implemented measures to mitigate fish deaths, but local villagers are resistant to proposals for creating new saltmarsh habitats by flooding farmland. The debate continues as EDF seeks a solution that satisfies both environmental concerns and local community interests.",
