    "news_text": "Elon Musk, the world&#x27;s richest man, defended the budget cuts implemented by Doge, which have led to significant disruption in the federal government. Speaking at a Conservative political meeting in Maryland, Musk praised the local time and the work of Doge, which he appears to lead. He was joined by Argentine President Javier Milei, who handed him a chainsaw as a symbol of their shared approach to public cuts. Both leaders discussed the urgent need for economic deregulation, believing it is crucial for the growth of their countries. Musk&#x27;s comments, including a metaphor about throwing darts at targets, were in response to questions about his efforts to identify fraud in the federal budget. He reiterated claims of social security fraud, suggesting that many individuals over 100 are receiving benefits, some of which have been incorrectly paid to deceased individuals. However, critics argue that Musk&#x27;s figures are exaggerated and misrepresent social security data.",
