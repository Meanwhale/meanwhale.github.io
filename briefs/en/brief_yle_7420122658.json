    "news_text": "Bitcoin surged to a new record of over $75,000 following Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential elections, which also positively impacted major European stock exchanges. The Frankfurt Dax Index and London FTSE 100 rose by about 1.5%, while the Paris CAC 40 fell by 2%. Tesla's stock increased by 12%, and in Helsinki, the general index rose by 0.6%. Trump's changing stance on cryptocurrencies, from calling them a fraud to promoting them, has led to increased demand for digital currencies, as reflected in Bitcoin's price surge. Meanwhile, U.S. stock markets also saw gains, with the Nasdaq up by 1.4% and the S&P 500 by 1.2%. The dollar fluctuated against the euro and yen as market dynamics shifted.",
