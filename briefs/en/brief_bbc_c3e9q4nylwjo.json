    "news_text": "A recent letter from the US, signed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, has criticized Israel's blockade of humanitarian aid to Gaza, demanding an expedited aid operation and warning of potential military assistance cuts if improvements are not made within 30 days. The letter highlights the severe humanitarian crisis affecting 1.7 million Palestinians and challenges Israel's actions against the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. It also addresses Israel's military strategy in northern Gaza, urging an end to forced evacuations and ensuring continuous access for aid agencies. The letter's release follows increasing pressure from the US and other international bodies, reflecting frustration over Israel's handling of aid amidst ongoing conflict. While Israel has allowed some aid convoys to enter Gaza since the letter, the effectiveness of these measures remains uncertain, especially with upcoming US elections potentially influencing future US-Israel relations.",
