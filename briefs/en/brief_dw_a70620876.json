    "news_text": "Bad Godesberg, a district in Bonn, Germany, is characterized by its stately early 20th-century villas and premium cars parked under towering trees. Many residents work for large corporations like Deutsche Telekom, which is phasing out combustion-engine vehicles in favor of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Other companies, like SAP and BASF, are also making gradual shifts towards electric and hybrid vehicles, but challenges remain, including the higher emissions from hybrids and the dominance of corporate fleets in overall car emissions. The German government provides subsidies for EV purchases but continues to support fossil fuel vehicles, leading to criticism. The slow transition to electric company cars is impacting sales for German automakers, despite their advocacy for electrification. The current system of company car subsidies primarily benefits higher-income individuals, prompting calls for more effective measures to reduce emissions.",
