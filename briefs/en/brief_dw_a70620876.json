    "news_text": "In Bad Godesberg, Bonn, the presence of early 20th-century villas is complemented by premium cars, primarily driven by high-earning employees of major corporations. Deutsche Telekom is phasing out combustion-engine vehicles, allowing only battery electric vehicles (BEVs) for new company cars. Other companies, like SAP and BASF, are also making moves towards electric and hybrid vehicles, but many still rely on traditional combustion engines. Corporate fleets significantly impact emissions, with company cars accounting for a large portion of new car registrations in Germany. Despite government subsidies for electric vehicles, the transition is slow, with only 12% of newly registered company cars being fully electric. The German auto industry advocates for electrification, but many companies remain hesitant to fully commit. The benefits of company-car subsidies disproportionately favor the wealthiest, prompting calls for more effective measures to reduce emissions.",
