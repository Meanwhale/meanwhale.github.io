    "news_text": "In Sweden, there has been a significant rise in the number of individuals under 15 suspected of serious crimes, including murder. The government is contemplating lowering the penalty age for serious offences to 14, particularly for crimes that carry a minimum sentence of four years. This proposal follows a report presented to Mr. Str\u00f6mmer and aims to address the growing involvement of younger individuals in violent crimes. However, it has faced criticism from researchers who argue that there is no evidence supporting the effectiveness of such a measure in reducing crime rates. A similar initiative in Denmark was discontinued after two years due to a lack of results. Experts suggest that focusing on preventive measures for youth may be more effective than punitive approaches. In Finland, the minimum age for criminal liability is 15, which is slightly above the European average.",
