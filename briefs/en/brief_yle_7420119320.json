    "news_text": "Hurricane Oscar arrived in Cuba early Monday and quickly weakened to a tropical storm. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel reported that at least six people died due to the storm, particularly in the eastern province of Guantamo. The US Hurricane Center warned of potential life-threatening floods and mudslides from heavy rains. Power outages began in Cuba on Friday due to issues at the largest power plant, although electricity has been restored to nearly 90% of Havana. Cuba produces only one-third of its electricity needs and has leased seven floating power plants from Turkish companies to strengthen its grid. The country is facing severe shortages of fuel, food, medicine, and water, exacerbated by a long-standing US embargo and an economic crisis that has worsened since the Soviet Union's collapse.",
