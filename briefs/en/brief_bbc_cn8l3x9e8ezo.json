    "news_text": "The Titan submersible, operated by Oceangate, aimed to take passengers on a deep-sea journey to the Titanic wreck but suffered a catastrophic failure during a dive on June 18, 2023, resulting in the deaths of all five individuals onboard. The US Coast Guard is conducting a public hearing to explore the reasons behind the disaster, focusing on the sub's unconventional design, ignored safety warnings, and the absence of regulatory oversight. Key issues include the sub's viewport rated for shallower depths, its cylindrical hull shape, and the use of carbon fiber, which is less reliable under extreme pressure. Despite warnings from industry experts about safety concerns, Oceangate's CEO dismissed them, emphasizing innovation over certification. The hearings aim to uncover the factors that led to this tragedy and prevent future incidents.",
