    "news_text": "The Titan submersible, which aimed to take passengers to the Titanic wreck at a depth of 3,800m, suffered a catastrophic implosion during its dive on June 18, 2023, resulting in the deaths of all five individuals on board. The US Coast Guard is conducting a public hearing to explore the reasons behind the disaster, including the sub's unconventional design, ignored safety warnings, and the absence of regulatory oversight. Key concerns include the sub's carbon fiber hull, which was not suitable for such depths, and its failure to undergo proper safety certification. Despite warnings from experts and former Oceangate staff about the sub's safety, the CEO dismissed these concerns. The hearings aim to uncover the circumstances leading to the tragedy and prevent future incidents.",
