    "news_text": "Turkey's strategic initiative in Africa, particularly in Somalia, includes exploring offshore oil fields and enhancing military cooperation. Since 1998, Turkey has aimed to strengthen ties with Africa, increasing its embassies from 12 to 44 and boosting trade from $5.4 billion in 2003 to over $41 billion in 2022. The Turkish government is focusing on Africa's young population and rising demand for goods, but faces competition from China, Russia, and Gulf countries. Recent agreements include exclusive rights for oil exploration off Somalia's coast and military deployments to improve security. Despite ambitious trade targets, Turkey has struggled to meet them and is advised to diversify its trade partnerships. Additionally, Turkey is becoming a key arms supplier and has invested significantly in civil projects across Africa, although it faces challenges in competing with Chinese firms for financing.",
