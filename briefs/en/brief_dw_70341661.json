    "news_text": "Farouk Khoury, an 86-year-old currency exchange shop owner in Beirut, expresses uncertainty about his business due to the escalating conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, which has led to a significant decrease in customers. The recent violence has resulted in over 500 deaths and prompted many countries to advise their citizens to leave Lebanon. Local businesses, including cafes and pharmacies, are also struggling, with fewer customers and increased demand for essential goods. The Lebanese economy, already weakened by a financial collapse in 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2020 port explosion, faces further challenges as the conflict intensifies. Agricultural sectors are severely affected, with reports of destroyed land and livestock. The tourism sector is nearly dead, with a drastic drop in activity. Overall, the situation is contributing to widespread despair and worsening economic conditions in Lebanon.",
