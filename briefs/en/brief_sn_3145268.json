    "news_text": "The text discusses the role of guano, or bird poop, in the expansion of U.S. imperialism during the mid-1800s. As demand for nitrogen-rich guano surged, the U.S. claimed ownership of several islands through the Guano Islands Act, marking its first overseas territorial acquisition. The guano trade was driven by European soil depletion and led to significant ecological changes in Peru, where guano diggers disrupted local bird populations. The eventual exhaustion of guano resources prompted a shift to Chilean nitrates, leading to further conflicts. The development of synthetic fertilizers in the early 1900s, based on insights gained from guano, revolutionized agriculture. The article emphasizes the importance of considering ecological factors in historical narratives of imperialism.",
