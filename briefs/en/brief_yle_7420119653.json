    "news_text": "In an interview with The New York Times magazine, John F. Kelly, former Chief of Staff for President Trump, expressed his worries about Trump's approach to governance. Kelly stated he would only speak the truth about Trump under specific conditions, particularly when he felt Trump was acting dangerously. He highlighted Trump's consideration of using the military against domestic threats and emphasized that Trump lacks an understanding of the U.S. Constitution and the rule of law. Kelly characterized Trump as potentially fascist, describing fascism as an authoritarian ideology focused on militarism and suppression of opposition. He noted Trump's admiration for authoritarian leaders and recalled Trump's claim in 2016 that he could commit violence without losing support. Kelly, a 74-year-old Marine, served in key roles in Trump's administration from 2017 to 2019.",
