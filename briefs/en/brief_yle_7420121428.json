    "news_text": "YIT's change and savings program has advanced rapidly, with net sales dropping to approximately EUR 1.3 billion and a loss of EUR 73 million. The order book has decreased from EUR 3.4 billion to EUR 2.7 billion. Despite these challenges, housing sales are strong in Eastern Central Europe and the Baltic region. However, there are no signs of recovery in the Finnish housing market, with no new consumer housing projects initiated in Finland for 2024, and low expectations for 2025. An interim report shows a decrease in unsold homes from 1,212 to 1,048, with most unsold apartments located in Finland.",
