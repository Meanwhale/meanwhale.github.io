    "news_text": "On Thursday, North Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) at the command of leader Kim Jong Un, with state media reporting that its flight records surpassed previous tests. Kim stated that the test-fire was a military action aimed at informing rivals of North Korea's capabilities. This launch follows intelligence reports indicating that North Korea is preparing for its seventh nuclear test and is close to testing a long-range missile that could reach the United States. The missile was fired toward the eastern waters of North Korea and is believed to have traveled approximately 1,000 kilometers at a high altitude. The U.S. condemned the launch, and South Korea announced new export controls to limit North Korea's missile development. Concerns are also rising about North Korean troops potentially aiding Russia in its conflict with Ukraine.",
