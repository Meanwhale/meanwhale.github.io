    "news_header": "New DUI regulations in Finland will improve efficiency in handling drunk driving cases.",
    "news_text": "Finland's new DUI regulations will eliminate the need for transporting offenders to police stations for testing, allowing immediate fines and driving bans to be issued at the roadside using new precision alcometers. The police will receive 200 new devices this year, doubling their current number, which will enhance DUI enforcement and reduce the time spent away from traffic control. The severity of fines varies based on the offense, with aggravated DUIs being handled by district courts. Overall, drunk driving incidents have significantly decreased over the past two decades, although the presence of other intoxicating substances in DUI cases has risen.",
