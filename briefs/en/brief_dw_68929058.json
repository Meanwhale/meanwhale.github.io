    "news_text": "Hydropower has been a reliable and low-carbon energy source for over a century, currently providing more electricity than all other renewables combined. However, recent droughts in Ecuador and Colombia, exacerbated by the El Nino phenomenon, have significantly reduced reservoir levels, leading to power shortages and a state of emergency in Ecuador. The situation is worsened by increasing energy demand and climate change impacts, such as more frequent droughts and floods. Globally, hydropower output saw a historic drop in early 2023, with China being the largest contributor to this decline. Countries heavily reliant on hydropower, especially in Africa, face vulnerabilities due to limited alternative energy sources. Experts suggest diversifying energy portfolios with wind and solar to mitigate risks. Innovations like floating solar panels on reservoirs show promise. Despite challenges, hydropower is expected to remain a key player in renewable energy, but significant investments and better management practices are necessary to enhance resilience against climate impacts.",
