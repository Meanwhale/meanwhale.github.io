    "news_text": "On Monday, Kamala Harris focused on reaching independent and Republican voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, known as the Democratic Party's 'blue wall'. Accompanied by former Congresswoman Liz Cheney, a prominent anti-Trump Republican, Harris opted for a town hall format rather than traditional rallies. The events featured discussions with Republican figures and were held in suburban areas with college-educated voters who have been shifting towards Democrats. Cheney encouraged Republicans to vote with their conscience, while Harris highlighted her campaign's outreach efforts. The events included questions on key issues like healthcare, Ukraine, and abortion, allowing both women to express their views on Trump's presidency. Current polls indicate a competitive race, with the potential for disaffected Republicans to support Harris, which could significantly impact her chances in the election.",
