    "news_text": "Researchers have found a new method to cook eggs that prevents the egg white from becoming rubbery while achieving a perfectly cooked yolk. By alternating between boiling water and water at 30\u00b0C, they discovered that this periodic cooking technique allows the yolk and white to reach their optimal temperatures at different times. The final recipe involves boiling the egg for two minutes, then transferring it to cooler water for two minutes, repeated eight times for a total of 32 minutes. This method results in a soft-boiled white and a yolk similar to sous vide eggs.",
