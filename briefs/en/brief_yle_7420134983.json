    "news_text": "The drought eliminated the living conditions for the Flores human and its main predator, potentially due to climate change. This species, discovered in 2003 on Flores Island, Indonesia, was small, measuring about 1.1 meters and weighing between 16 to 28 kg, often referred to as 'hobbit.' Their skull volume was only 400 cubic centimeters, significantly smaller than modern humans. While volcanic activity was initially thought to be the cause of their extinction, Professor Michael Gagan suggests drought may have played a key role. Research indicates a 38% decrease in annual rainfall over 20,000 years, impacting the availability of food sources like the Stegodons, which may have driven the Flores human to seek resources elsewhere, leading to dangerous encounters with modern humans. Evolution had adapted both the Flores human and Stegodons to their island environment, but climate change occurred too rapidly for their survival.",
