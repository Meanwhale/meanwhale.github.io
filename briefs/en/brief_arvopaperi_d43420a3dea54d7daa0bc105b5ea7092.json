    "news_text": "The Lindex Group intends to close the Itis Stockmann department store and initiate negotiations regarding staff changes. The lease for the store expires on August 1, 2025, and the store currently employs about 35 people. The negotiations are expected to last around six weeks, during which the company will explore employment opportunities at other locations for affected staff. The planned closure is not anticipated to significantly affect the financial position of the Stockmann division or the Lindex group. Riku Lylly, the operational director, stated that while options for extending the lease were explored, a sustainable solution was not found.",
