    "news_text": "The Babine Trail, an ancient Indigenous route in northwestern British Columbia, is at risk due to the Prince Rupert Gas Transmission pipeline project. Indigenous groups, including the Gitxsan people, are marking the trail to reconnect with their heritage and advocate against the pipeline's construction, which threatens their cultural landscape. Despite legal recognition of oral histories as valid evidence of land rights, economic development often takes precedence over Indigenous claims. The use of modern technology like lidar is helping Indigenous communities document and protect their cultural resources, but challenges remain as development pressures continue.",
