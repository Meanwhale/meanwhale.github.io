    "news_text": "Boeing announced plans to reduce its workforce by 17,000 jobs, representing 10% of its global staff, as it anticipates significant losses for the third quarter following a machinists' strike that began on September 13. The strike, involving 33,000 workers, halted production of key aircraft models, including the 737 MAX, 767, and 777. CEO David Calhoun stated that the cuts will affect executives, managers, and employees to align with the company's financial situation. Boeing expects third-quarter revenue of $17.8 billion and a loss per share of $9.97. Additionally, the delivery of the 777X has been delayed to 2026 due to development challenges and the ongoing strike, which is costing the company an estimated $1 billion a month. The strike's resolution is critical for Boeing to maintain its investment-grade credit rating.",
