    "news_text": "Boeing announced on Friday that it will reduce its global workforce by 10%, equating to 17,000 jobs, as it anticipates a significant loss in the third quarter following a machinists' strike that began on September 13. The strike, involving 33,000 workers, halted production of key aircraft models. CEO David Calhoun stated that the workforce reduction will affect executives, managers, and employees to align with the company's financial situation. Boeing now expects a revenue of $17.8 billion and a loss per share of $9.97 for the third quarter. Additionally, the delivery of the 777X has been delayed to 2026 due to ongoing development challenges and the strike. The strike is estimated to cost Boeing $1 billion per month and poses a risk to its investment-grade credit rating.",
