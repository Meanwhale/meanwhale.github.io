    "news_text": "The EU Summit highlights improved attitudes towards migration, contrasting with a decade ago when migration issues were largely ignored. The European Commission may review rejected asylum applications, and Italy's Minister Georgia Meloni is advocating for Albania as a destination for asylum seekers. The right to asylum is recognized as a fundamental international right, yet the EU faces challenges, particularly at the Russian border and with Poland dealing with displaced individuals from Belarus. The 2015 refugee crisis, marked by over 1.3 million arrivals, has left lasting impacts, leading to agreements with countries like Turkey, Libya, and Tunisia to manage migration. Finland aims to export asylum processes to third countries, while rising right-wing party popularity in Europe reflects growing opposition to migration. As crises, including conflicts in the Middle East and climate change, drive more people to seek refuge, countries like Germany are tightening border controls, causing tensions with neighboring nations regarding the acceptance of asylum seekers.",
