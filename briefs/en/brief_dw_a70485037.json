    "news_text": "The Chaplin Office, situated in Paris, is dedicated to managing and preserving the legacy of Charlie Chaplin, who was born in England, made significant films in Hollywood, and spent his later years in Switzerland. The office oversees various rights-holding companies that handle Chaplin's archives, trademarks, and film copyrights, all controlled by the Chaplin family. Arnold Lozano, the current managing director, balances respecting the family's wishes while promoting Chaplin's work globally. The office deals with licensing agreements, merchandising, and copyright enforcement, ensuring Chaplin's films remain relevant and accessible. Despite the challenges, Lozano finds fulfillment in witnessing audiences enjoy Chaplin's timeless humor and emotion. The future of copyright protection for Chaplin's films is uncertain, with legal protections set to expire in 2047, prompting the office to focus on preserving the best copies of his work.",
