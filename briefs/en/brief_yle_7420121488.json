    "news_text": "Georgia's prosecutor's office announced the launch of 47 separate investigations into potential election fraud. Despite partial complaints, electoral authorities maintain that the election results reflect the opposition's claims of fraud. The Central Election Committee confirmed that the ruling party won the election, with only slight changes in the final results. Opposition parties are refusing to join the new parliament, demanding new elections monitored by international observers. The investigations, requested by both opposition and government parties, focus on election day events and prior occurrences, with two arrests made for tampering with ballots.",
