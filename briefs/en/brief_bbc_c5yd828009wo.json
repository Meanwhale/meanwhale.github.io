    "news_text": "Ed Miliband, the Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary, has refrained from expressing his personal opinion on the expansion of Heathrow airport, despite the Labour government&#x27;s recent support for a third runway as part of an economic growth agenda. In 2010, Miliband opposed the expansion due to environmental concerns. He stated that he adheres to collective responsibility within the government and emphasized that any future plans must meet carbon budgets and local environmental standards. He also discussed the importance of transitioning to clean energy and the need for fair energy performance standards in rental properties.",
