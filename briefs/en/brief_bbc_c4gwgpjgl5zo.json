    "news_text": "Employers are concerned about rising costs due to increased National Insurance and minimum wage hikes, which may impact future pay rises and investment. Annual pay growth, excluding bonuses, was reported at 5.9%, with private sector growth at 6.2% and public sector at 4.7%. The inflation rate stands at 2.5%. A downward trend in pay growth is expected as demand for staff declines and worker availability improves.",
