    "news_original_title": "Ghostly white northern lights present new auroral mystery",
    "news_text": "Scientists at the University of Calgary have identified unusual grayish-white glows intertwined with the northern lights, which are not auroras themselves but may share a similar formation process to the mauve light streak known as STEVE. These glows were first observed in TREx mission images, leading to the discovery of 30 instances over several years. The whitish lights, characterized by continuum emission, differ from typical auroras and may indicate unknown atmospheric heating processes. This research could provide insights into the chemistry behind STEVE and enhance our understanding of auroral phenomena.",
