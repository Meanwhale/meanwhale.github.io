    "news_text": "Chancellor Olaf Scholz's meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in Istanbul, his first visit in two and a half years, is expected to be challenging. The agenda includes discussions on the Israel conflict, the war in Ukraine, migration issues, and Turkey's request for Eurofighter Typhoon fighters from Germany. Tensions exist due to Erdo\u011fan's criticism of Israel's actions and Germany's support for Israel's right to defend itself. Despite these tensions, Germany may approve Turkey's fighter request but could delay delivery and impose usage restrictions. Experts suggest that a deal on the fighters is likely as both countries have mutual political and economic interests.",
