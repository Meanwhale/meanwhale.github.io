    "news_header": "The Nobel Prizes, awarded annually, celebrate significant scientific achievements but face criticism for their relevance, bias towards Western male scientists, and the portrayal of individual genius over collaborative efforts.",
    "news_text": "Every October, scientists are surprised by calls announcing their Nobel Prize wins, leading to media coverage that often oversimplifies complex scientific achievements. While the prizes highlight important advancements, such as COVID-19 vaccines and gene editing, they also raise questions about their relevance and inclusivity. Historically, the prizes favored male scientists from the US and Europe, with less than 15% of laureates being women and few from outside these regions. Critics argue that the awards can perpetuate inequalities in funding and recognition, although they also serve to inspire interest in science, particularly in countries like India. The perception of the 'genius scientist' is evolving, with a growing recognition of the collaborative nature of scientific research.",
