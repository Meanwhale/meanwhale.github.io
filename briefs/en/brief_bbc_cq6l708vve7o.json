    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has defended the recent tax increases for employers outlined in last week's Budget, asserting that raising funds is essential for stabilizing public finances. The decision to raise National Insurance contributions has faced backlash from various sectors, including healthcare providers. Critics, including new Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, argue that the move will hinder economic growth and negatively impact wages. The Budget plans to increase spending significantly, funded partly by tax hikes and borrowing. Reeves acknowledges the criticism but emphasizes the need for these measures to address the financial situation left by the previous government. Changes to inheritance tax rules have also sparked controversy, particularly among farmers.",
