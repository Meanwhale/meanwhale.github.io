    "news_original_title": "Nigerian communities take Shell to court over oil spills",
    "news_text": "A significant hearing is taking place in London&#x27;s High Court, where Niger Delta community leaders are suing Shell for environmental damage caused by oil spills. The Ogale and Bille communities, totaling around 50,000 people, claim that Shell&#x27;s operations have devastated their environment, livelihoods, and health. Since 1958, over 1.5 million tons of crude oil have been spilled in the region. The trial, which began on February 13 and is set to continue until March 10, follows years of delays by Shell, which has denied legal responsibility. Local communities have sought accountability and compensation for pollution affecting their land and water. Many residents rely on fishing and farming, but oil spills have made these activities increasingly difficult. Community leaders argue that Shell must be held accountable for the damage, while Shell claims that most spills result from illegal activities. The current hearing will determine Shell&#x27;s liability under Nigerian law, with a further trial scheduled for 2026.",
