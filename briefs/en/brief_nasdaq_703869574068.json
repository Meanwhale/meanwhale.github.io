    "news_text": "Copper is a critical resource for the modern world, with demand growing due to urbanization, energy transition, and electric vehicles. However, supply is limited as major mines like Codelco\u2019s Chuquicamata and Rio Tinto\u2019s Bingham Canyon are aging and returning lower grades. Industry experts at the Vancouver Resource Investment Conference discussed these challenges, emphasizing the need for new discoveries and investment in mining. They noted that while demand will rise, particularly from developing nations, financing issues and lengthy permitting processes hinder the industry's ability to meet this demand. Investors are advised to focus on experienced teams and the financial health of mining companies.",
