    "news_text": "In the third quarter, China's economy expanded at its slowest rate since early last year, with a GDP growth of 4.6%, below the government's target of around 5%. Although this figure was slightly better than analysts' expectations, it marks the second consecutive quarter of growth below the target, raising concerns about the government's economic goals. Recent measures announced by Beijing aim to support growth, but experts warn that significant stimulus will be necessary to meet the target. The property sector continues to be a major drag on the economy, with new home prices declining at a rapid pace. The central bank has called for increased lending to stimulate growth, and the government has introduced a substantial stimulus package to address economic challenges, including a property crisis and low consumer confidence.",
