    "news_text": "Storytelling through film can change perceptions and moral views. A recent study published in PNAS found that watching the docudrama 'Just Mercy' increased empathy towards incarcerated individuals and support for reforms in the US criminal justice system. Participants showed a greater capacity to understand the emotions of formerly incarcerated people and were more likely to support educational programs in prisons and oppose the death penalty. The study highlights the influence of audiovisual content on public opinion and behavior, suggesting that films can serve as tools for social change. However, the long-term effects of such films on political and moral views remain an open question, with ongoing research examining the durability of these empathetic responses.",
