    "news_text": "Storytelling, particularly through film, can change perceptions and moral views. A recent study published in PNAS found that watching the docudrama 'Just Mercy,' which tells the story of a wrongly convicted man, significantly increased viewers' empathy towards incarcerated individuals and support for criminal justice reforms. Participants showed improved understanding of the emotions of formerly incarcerated people and were more likely to advocate for educational programs in prisons and oppose the death penalty. The research highlights the power of audiovisual content in shaping public opinion and behavior, suggesting that films can serve as tools for social change. The study also raises questions about the longevity of these empathetic feelings and the responsibility filmmakers have in influencing viewers' perceptions.",
