    "news_original_title": "Katso 6 kuvaa: n\u00e4in rajusti Ven\u00e4j\u00e4n sota iski Suomen talouteen \u2013 mutta miksi selvisimme rys\u00e4yksest\u00e4?",
    "news_text": "Three years ago, Finland&#x27;s economy was severely impacted when trade relations with Russia collapsed, resulting in the loss of a key trading partner. Historically reliant on Russian imports for electricity and oil, Finland had to adapt quickly, with electricity imports from Russia ceasing in May 2022. Despite initial economic downturns, Finland has managed to recover, with exports to the US and other countries compensating for the loss. However, challenges remain, particularly in Eastern Finland where unemployment has risen. The government has increased defense spending significantly, which, while boosting investor confidence, has also contributed to national debt. Overall, Finland&#x27;s ability to recover from crises has been notable, but the long-term economic outlook remains uncertain.",
