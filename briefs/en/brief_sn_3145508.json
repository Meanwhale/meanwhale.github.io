    "news_text": "A recent study indicates that the Altar Stone at Stonehenge may originate from Scotland rather than Wales, suggesting that Late Neolithic groups had long-distance connections. Geoscientist Anthony Clarke argues against the idea that glaciers transported the stone, citing a lack of evidence for glacial erratics in southern Britain. Additionally, new research links stratospheric air intrusion events to cloud formation, proposing that ozone from the stratosphere may enhance the production of cloud condensation nuclei. Finally, a chemical analysis suggests that the asteroid responsible for the dinosaurs' extinction came from beyond Jupiter, igniting debate about Jupiter's role in protecting Earth from asteroid impacts.",
