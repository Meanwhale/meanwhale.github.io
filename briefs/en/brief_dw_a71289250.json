    "news_text": "Chancellor Olaf Scholz has dismissed US President-elect Donald Trump's demand for NATO allies, including Germany, to increase defense spending to at least 5% of GDP, stating it would require massive tax increases or cuts to essential services. Germany only reached the NATO target of 2% last year and Scholz assured that this level will be maintained. Despite tight budget constraints, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius emphasized the need for increased military spending. Other NATO figures have shown support for Trump's ambitious target, viewing it as a necessary wake-up call for member states.",
