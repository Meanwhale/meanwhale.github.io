    "news_text": "European stocks are expected to drift lower at the open on Friday following Amazon's better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, although its revenue outlook for the first quarter fell short of projections. The company plans to invest over $100 billion in AI this year. Investors are also anticipating the U.S. jobs report and preliminary consumer sentiment and inflation readings for February. Asian markets were mixed, with Chinese and Hong Kong stocks rising due to optimism in tech, while U.S. stocks ended mixed as investors awaited Amazon's results. Economic indicators showed a rise in initial jobless claims and slower productivity growth, impacting labor costs. European stocks reached a record high on Thursday, buoyed by a Bank of England rate cut and strong earnings.",
