    "news_text": "Statistics Finland reported a 17% decrease in the cubic volume of building permits granted from June to August 2024 compared to the previous year, totaling 6.5 million cubic meters. Juho Centralnen, the main economist at Hyn, noted that consumer decision-making is influenced by uncertainty, despite sufficient work availability and an economy on a growth trajectory. Hypo forecasts an increase in housing projects starting next year. While plots are more available historically, plot prices are declining slowly, which may enhance construction profitability.",
