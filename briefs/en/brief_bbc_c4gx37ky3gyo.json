    "news_original_title": "Earth&#x27;s inner core may have changed shape, say scientists",
    "news_text": "A group of scientists led by Prof John Vidale has found evidence that Earth&#x27;s inner core may have changed shape in the last 20 years, deforming by over 100m in some areas. This inner core is crucial as it generates the magnetic field that protects life on Earth. The research indicates that the shape change could be occurring at the boundary with the liquid outer core, influenced by extreme heat and gravitational forces. The findings, published in Nature Geoscience, also relate to the inner core&#x27;s rotation speed and its connection to Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. While the changes may not impact daily life, they are vital for understanding the Earth&#x27;s core and its effects on the magnetic field.",
