    "news_text": "A report from Las Vegas Realtors reveals that in September 2024, the median price of existing single-family homes in Southern Nevada was $479,900, a 6.6% increase from the previous year, while the median price for condos and townhomes rose to $299,500, up 10.9%. Although home sales declined slightly compared to September 2023, the interest rate cut by the Fed is expected to positively impact the housing market. By the end of September, there were significant increases in the number of homes listed without offers. Cash transactions made up 24.4% of sales, and distressed sales remained low at 0.8%. These statistics reflect the market activity through September 2024.",
