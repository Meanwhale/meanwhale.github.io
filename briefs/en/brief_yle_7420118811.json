    "news_text": "OyJ is extending its efficiency program initiated last year, targeting annual savings of EUR 7 million for 2025 and 2026. The restructuring will consolidate five regional companies into three, creating an eastern Finnish regional company, a central Finnish regional company, and a third company in Uusimaa. This new structure aims to enhance operational efficiency and reduce management layers, with an expected saving of \u20ac2.5 million, primarily affecting personnel. CEO Vesa-Pekka Kangaskorva noted that while there will be redundancies in administration, significant layoffs are not anticipated. The changes will not impact customers directly, and there are currently no plans to close newspapers. Additionally, the Central Swiss printing company will transition to a new printing facility in Lahti, expecting to save EUR 1.5 million annually, with EUR 1 million affecting personnel. These measures are part of an ongoing enhancement program that began in August 2023, with savings targets set to be realized by early 2027.",
