    "news_original_title": "Trump &#x27;very frustrated&#x27; and Zelensky must strike minerals deal, says adviser",
    "news_text": "Ukrainian President Zelensky faces pressure to negotiate US access to Ukraine&#x27;s critical minerals, following his rejection of US demands. White House adviser Mike Waltz expressed frustration over Zelensky&#x27;s recent comments about Trump. The US sees Ukraine&#x27;s mineral wealth as a potential exchange for aid, but Zelensky insists he cannot &#x27;sell our state.&#x27; Despite a meeting with US envoy Kellogg, which Zelensky called productive, tensions remain high. The US&#x27;s shifting stance on negotiations with Russia, without Ukraine&#x27;s involvement, raises concerns for Zelensky, who emphasizes that discussions about Ukraine should include Ukraine. The ongoing war, initiated by Russia&#x27;s invasion, complicates these dynamics.",
