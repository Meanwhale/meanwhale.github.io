By analyzing diaries and documents written in various languages, they found evidence of climate conditions that included heat, droughts, and subsequent heavy rainfall. The findings suggest that the Little Ice Age may have been delayed in Transylvania compared to Western Europe, and highlight how climate events influenced human suffering, including famine and disease. This research is crucial for understanding future climate change impacts.",
