    "news_text": "Wage growth in the UK has slowed to 4.9%, the lowest in over two years, leading to heightened expectations that the Bank of England will cut interest rates to 4.75% in November. Although wages are still outpacing inflation, analysts believe this will not hinder rate cut plans. The unemployment rate has dropped to 4%, but caution is advised due to potential inaccuracies in the data. Job vacancies have decreased, and recruitment firms report a slowdown in the jobs market amid economic uncertainty. Concerns about worker shortages persist, particularly among younger individuals. Additionally, revised wage figures may impact state pension costs. Overall, the economic outlook remains cautious as firms weigh hiring decisions against potential changes in labor costs.",
