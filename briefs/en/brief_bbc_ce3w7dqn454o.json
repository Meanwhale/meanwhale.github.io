    "news_header": "Expectations for a UK interest rate cut have increased due to slowing wage growth, with analysts predicting a reduction to 4.75% next month despite rising pay still outpacing inflation.",
    "news_text": "Wage growth in the UK has slowed to 4.9%, the lowest in over two years, leading to heightened expectations that the Bank of England will cut interest rates to 4.75% in November. Although pay is rising faster than inflation, analysts believe this will not prevent a rate cut. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4%, but caution is advised due to potential inaccuracies in the data. Job vacancies have decreased, and recruitment firms report a slowdown in the jobs market, attributed to sluggish economic growth and high interest rates. Concerns over worker shortages persist, particularly among younger adults, with a jobless rate of 12.8% for those aged 18-24. Additionally, revised wage figures may impact state pension payments, posing a financial challenge for the Chancellor ahead of the Budget.",
