    "news_original_title": "Prosecutors told to drop NYC mayor corruption case",
    "news_text": "The US Justice Department has directed federal prosecutors to dismiss corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. This decision, made by Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, claims that the indictment limited Adams&#x27; capacity to tackle illegal immigration and violent crime. Adams, who has built a closer relationship with Trump, is accused of accepting illegal campaign funds and gifts. He has pleaded not guilty to five charges. The memo suggests that the case may be revisited after the 2025 mayoral election, but no further investigative steps should be taken until then. Critics argue that Adams&#x27; cooperation with federal immigration authorities undermines local sanctuary laws.",
