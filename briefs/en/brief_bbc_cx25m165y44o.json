    "news_original_title": "Prosecutors told to drop NYC mayor corruption case",
    "news_text": "The US justice department has directed prosecutors to dismiss the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove stated that the indictment could affect the upcoming mayoral election and has limited Adams&#x27; ability to tackle issues like illegal immigration and violent crime. Adams faces accusations of accepting illegal campaign funds from Turkish businessmen and has pleaded not guilty to several charges. The memo suggests that the case may be revisited after the November 2025 election, and it also calls for restoring Adams&#x27; security clearance. Critics argue that the case was politically motivated, and Adams&#x27; lawyer claims this is a victory for the mayor.",
