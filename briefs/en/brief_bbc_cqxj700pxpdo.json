    "news_text": "Pete Middleton, a retired programmer living in Northamptonshire, UK, has embraced technology throughout his life, particularly AI, which he uses for various tasks. Diagnosed with dementia five years ago, he has experienced memory challenges but believes AI can enhance independence and self-esteem for individuals with dementia. Various AI tools, such as the Simon app and the Florence Project, aim to support daily routines and communication for those living with dementia.
