    "news_original_title": "Exposing an Indian pharma firm fuelling West Africa&#x27;s opioid crisis",
    "news_text": "An investigation reveals that Aveo Pharmaceuticals, an Indian company, is manufacturing and illegally exporting unlicensed opioids to West Africa, exacerbating a significant public health crisis in countries like Ghana, Nigeria, and Cote D&#x27;Ivoire. The drugs, containing a dangerous mix of tapentadol and carisoprodol, are popular as cheap street drugs despite their severe health risks, including overdose and addiction. Local authorities are struggling to combat the crisis, with task forces formed to raid drug dealers. The BBC&#x27;s undercover investigation exposed Aveo&#x27;s practices, highlighting the indifference of its executives towards the harm caused by their products. The situation is dire, with millions of young people at risk, and the Indian government is urged to take stricter actions against such malpractice.",
