    "news_text": "Sainsbury's has announced the elimination of 3,000 jobs as it closes its remaining caf\u00e9s and reduces its patisserie and pizza counters. The supermarket aims to simplify its operations, noting that most customers do not frequently use the caf\u00e9s. Additionally, there will be a 20% reduction in senior management roles due to a challenging cost environment. Rising National Insurance contributions are also impacting the restructuring plan. The British Retail Consortium warns that higher costs will affect jobs and prices. Sainsbury's has previously reported strong profits but is facing tough choices due to economic pressures. The Unite union criticized the job cuts as profiteering, while industry experts suggest these cuts may be the beginning of broader changes in retail.",
