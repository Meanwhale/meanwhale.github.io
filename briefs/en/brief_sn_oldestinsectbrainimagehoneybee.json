    "news_text": "A manuscript from the mid-1670s features the oldest known illustration of an insect brain, created by Dutch biologist Johannes Swammerdam. This depiction of a honeybee drone's brain, based on Swammerdam's dissections, reveals his pioneering work in entomology. Although he mistakenly identified some brain structures, his observations laid the groundwork for future studies of insect anatomy. The manuscript highlights the challenges he faced with limited technology, yet he managed to identify some nerve connections.",
