    "news_text": "In his first testimony regarding his controversial war on drugs, former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte acknowledged the existence of a 'death squad' composed of gangsters, which he used to suppress crime while serving as mayor. He claimed to have instructed the squad to kill specific individuals, asserting that he would kill them if they failed to comply. Duterte defended his actions during a senate hearing, stating he had no regrets and did what he believed was necessary for the country. He denied giving police chiefs permission to kill suspects, emphasizing that the squad was not made up of police officers. His anti-drug campaign, which resulted in thousands of deaths, is currently under investigation by the International Criminal Court. Despite facing accusations from victims' families and critics, Duterte remained defiant, claiming that crime had surged after his presidency and expressing a willingness to continue his aggressive tactics if given another chance.",
