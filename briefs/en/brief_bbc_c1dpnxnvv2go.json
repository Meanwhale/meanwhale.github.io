    "news_text": "Projections indicate that 2024 will likely be the hottest year on record, with global average temperatures expected to exceed 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. This alarming trend is primarily attributed to human-induced climate change, compounded by natural factors like the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. The Royal Meteorological Society emphasizes the urgency for action at the upcoming COP29 climate conference. If the 1.5C threshold is breached, it would symbolize a significant challenge to global climate goals established in the Paris Agreement. Despite potential cooling from La Ni\u00f1a, rising greenhouse gas levels suggest new temperature records may soon follow.",
