    "news_text": "Journalist Roosa Laksio investigates the emotional impact of music, revealing that it can trigger a wide range of feelings from joy to deep sorrow. Music affects various brain areas related to hearing, memory, attention, and emotions. Professor John Sloboda's research shows that specific melodies can elicit powerful emotional responses, with the same song affecting different listeners in contrasting ways. For instance, Adele's 'Someone Like You' can release tension and provoke tears. A 2017 study by the American Psychological Association found that people experience different emotions while crying, with some feeling joy and inspiration from music, while others may experience sadness and anxiety due to difficult memories.",
