    "news_text": "A series of parcel fires at courier companies in Poland, Germany, and the UK are suspected to be dry runs for sabotaging flights to the US and Canada, according to Polish prosecutors. Four arrests have been made, and investigations are ongoing across Europe. Western officials suspect Russia's GRU military intelligence agency is behind these incidents, which involved parcels containing hidden explosives that spontaneously ignited. The fires, which occurred in July, are believed to have originated from electric massage machines containing a magnesium-based substance, making them difficult to extinguish, especially on planes. The incidents have prompted heightened security measures for US-bound cargo and investigations by counter-terrorism police.",
