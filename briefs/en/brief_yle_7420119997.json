    "news_text": "Mikko Kautto, CEO of the Finnish Centre for Pensions, highlights that Finland's pension system must adapt to changing demographics, particularly due to increased immigration. Statistics Finland predicts a significant population rise, potentially reaching six million in 15 years if current migration trends continue. This demographic shift could enhance the financial outlook for the earnings-related pension scheme, as a larger working-age population would lead to increased pension contributions. However, Kautto warns that migration assumptions are uncertain and could lead to higher pension expenditures in the long run. He stresses the importance of considering both positive and negative demographic changes in pension policy, advocating for reforms that account for long-term uncertainties and establish mechanisms to handle potential shocks. While current projections are optimistic, Kautto urges political decision-makers to remain grounded and prepare for future developments.",
