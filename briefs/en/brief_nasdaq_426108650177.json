    "news_text": "In January, U.S. equities ended higher, with the S&amp;P 500 hitting record highs. Small-cap stocks also improved, and Treasuries were firmer. Gold and Bitcoin futures saw significant gains. The market was influenced by animal spirits and corporate buybacks, despite new tariffs announced by the Trump administration on Mexico, Canada, and China. The AI sector faced scrutiny due to a new Chinese model affecting stock prices. The Fed maintained benchmark rates, and economic data showed mixed results, with core CPI slightly above consensus. Earnings reports from S&amp;P 500 companies were mixed, with a majority reporting above estimates but lower growth rates compared to historical averages. February will conclude the earnings season and bring more economic data.",
