    "news_header": "As the US election approaches, both Democrats and Republicans agree on maintaining pressure on China, with differing strategies expected from candidates Trump and Harris.",
    "news_text": "With the US election nearing, both major parties are united in their approach to China, emphasizing economic and strategic pressure. Donald Trump initiated a trade war during his presidency, a stance that President Biden has largely continued. If elected, Kamala Harris is expected to align with Biden's policies but may have a different approach. Experts suggest that regardless of who wins, China's position will remain largely unchanged. Trump has proposed significant tariffs on Chinese goods and a strong response to Chinese aggression towards Taiwan, while Harris's foreign policy remains less defined. Analysts indicate that China might prefer a Trump victory due to potential divisions in US democracy, while others believe Harris could foster more constructive engagement with China.",
