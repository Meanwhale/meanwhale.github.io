    "news_text": "Ecuador is set to choose its next president in an April runoff election after both incumbent President Daniel Noboa and leftist opponent Luisa Gonzalez failed to secure a majority in Sunday&#x27;s first round. Noboa received 44.4% of the votes, while Gonzalez garnered 43.9%. The country is facing its worst crisis in decades due to drug cartel violence and economic issues. Both candidates campaigned under heavy security following the assassination of a leading candidate in the last election. Noboa aims to continue his hardline policies against organized crime, while Gonzalez promises to address crime through military operations and social spending. The situation in Ecuador has deteriorated as it has become a hub for drug trafficking, leading to increased violence and crime rates.",
