    "news_text": "As Donald Trump prepares to take office, he is expected to focus on undocumented immigrants, primarily from Central America. However, many migrants from these regions can legally work in the U.S. through the H-2A visa program, which allows them to work on farms for up to 12 months. Sandra Noemi Bucu Saz, a Guatemalan farm laborer, shares her experience of earning significantly more in the U.S. than in Guatemala. Despite the opportunities, many still fall victim to scams while seeking visas. Organizations like Cierto aim to help locals avoid these scams and connect them with legitimate job opportunities. While the H-2A program offers hope, there are concerns about the future of such visa schemes under Trump's administration.",
