    "news_text": "A supermoon is defined as a full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth in its orbit, making it appear larger and brighter. Full moons occur when the side of the moon facing Earth is fully illuminated by the sun. The term 'supermoon' is often used interchangeably with 'full supermoon.' In contrast, a micromoon is a full moon at its farthest point from Earth. Strawberry supermoons, which occur around late June, are named for the strawberry harvest in North America, while in Europe, they are referred to as Mead or Honey Moons due to honey harvesting. Supermoons can appear 14-17% larger and 30% brighter than micromoons and are best viewed at moonrise, just after sunset, or moonset, just before sunrise. Supermoons typically occur three to four times a year and are visible for about three days. A rare super blood moon can occur when a lunar eclipse coincides with a supermoon.",
