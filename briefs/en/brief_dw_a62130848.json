    "news_text": "Scientists define a supermoon as a full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth in its orbit, making it appear significantly larger and brighter. Full moons occur when the moon's side facing Earth is fully illuminated by the sun. Supermoons are often referred to as full supermoons, while the opposite phenomenon, a micromoon, occurs when the moon is at its farthest point from Earth. Notably, the Strawberry supermoon occurs around late June, named for the strawberry harvest in North America, while in Europe, it is known as the Mead or Honey Moon due to honey harvesting. Supermoons can appear 14-17% larger and 30% brighter than micromoons and are best viewed at moonrise, sunset, or moonset. They occur three to four times a year and are visible for about three days. A rare super blood moon can occur when a lunar eclipse coincides with a supermoon.",
