    "news_text": "Zhang Yiming, co-founder of ByteDance, has reached a net worth of $49.3 billion, making him the richest person in China, according to the Hurun Research Institute. His wealth increased by 43% from 2023, largely due to TikTok's global success, despite concerns over its ties to the Chinese government and impending US regulations. While Zhang stepped down from his role in 2021, he still owns about 20% of ByteDance. The Hurun report noted that only 30% of the individuals on the list saw an increase in their net worth, with the list shrinking for the third consecutive year due to a struggling Chinese economy. Other tech leaders like Pony Ma of Tencent also feature prominently, but many in the sector have faced declines in wealth.",
