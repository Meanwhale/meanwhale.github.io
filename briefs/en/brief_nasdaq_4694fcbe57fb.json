    "news_text": "Chipotle Mexican Grill has reported strong financial performance for Q4 and full year 2024, with significant revenue growth and profitability. However, the stock price has declined due to conservative guidance for 2025 and external economic concerns, particularly regarding tariffs on key ingredients. Analysts generally maintain a positive outlook, with a consensus rating of Moderate Buy, although some have lowered price targets. This situation presents a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors, but caution is advised due to market volatility and economic uncertainty.",
