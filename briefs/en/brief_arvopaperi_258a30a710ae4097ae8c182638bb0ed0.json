    "news_text": "The result period in the United States continues to be lively, with Amazon's earnings being highly anticipated. After the market opened, major indices showed slight gains: the Dow Jones was up 0.1%, and both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq increased by 0.2%. Honeywell reported good results but disappointed with its guidance and announced plans to split into three companies, causing its stock to drop. Eli Lilly's report was mixed but overall exceeded projections. Hershey's shares rose by about 3.5% due to better-than-expected sales figures for the fourth quarter, while the CEO plans to retire next year. Qualcomm and Ford disappointed investors with their results, leading to declines in their shares. Additionally, new unemployment claims in the US rose beyond expectations, and a comprehensive labor market report will be released soon, which the Fed will closely monitor. Investors are also keeping an eye on President Trump's trade policy movements.",
