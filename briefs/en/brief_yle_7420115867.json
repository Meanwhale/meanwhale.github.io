    "news_text": "Laakson yhteissairaala is set to make a contract worth up to \u20ac14.5 million for geothermal wells that would reach depths of over three kilometers, which is exceptionally deep for Finland. If successful, this project could provide a much-needed low-emission heating source. The drilling will be conducted by the Korean company Hanjin D&B, starting with one well at a depth of 3,000 to 3,500 meters for \u20ac5.9 million, with options for two additional wells at \u20ac8.6 million. The project is ambitious, as it aims to drill deeper than any existing geothermal wells in Finland. Previous attempts in Finland have faced challenges, including technical difficulties and geological issues. Despite these challenges, experts believe that drilling to these depths is feasible with the right equipment and preparation.",
