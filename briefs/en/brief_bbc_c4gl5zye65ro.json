    "news_text": "A fuel tanker exploded in northern Nigeria, killing at least 147 people who had gathered to collect leaking petrol after the vehicle overturned. The incident occurred in Majia, Jigawa state, late Tuesday night, despite police warnings to stay away. Approximately 100 others were injured, many critically, and have been hospitalized. The driver, unharmed, is in custody as investigations continue. Rescue efforts revealed many victims were burned beyond recognition, and a mass burial was conducted for most of the deceased.
