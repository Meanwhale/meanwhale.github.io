    "news_header": "The Biden administration has imposed severe sanctions on Russia's oil sector, targeting key vessels and producers, aiming to pressure Russia amid its ongoing military spending.",
    "news_text": "In its final days, the Biden administration has taken significant action against Russian oil, a major revenue source for President Putin. On January 10, the White House announced sanctions that blacklisted nearly 200 vessels and targeted major oil producers. Analysts believe these measures will significantly impact Russia's oil operations, especially as the country has been using a shadow fleet to evade previous sanctions. Despite a recovery in oil revenues, the new sanctions are expected to increase pressure on Russia's economy, particularly as military spending rises. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy emphasized that reducing Russia's oil revenue will hasten the restoration of peace.",
