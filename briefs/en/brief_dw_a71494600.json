    "news_text": "Recent sabotage attacks on underwater cables, attributed to a Russian 'shadow fleet,' reveal significant vulnerabilities in global telecommunications infrastructure. Submarine cables are crucial for transmitting data and connecting energy sources, yet they are often inadequately protected against deliberate destruction. While the US and EU invest in satellite technologies for secure communication, submarine cables remain the primary means of data transmission. The cables are complex structures designed to withstand harsh underwater conditions, but they face threats from both natural and human-made sources. Experts advocate for improved protection strategies and legal frameworks to safeguard these vital communication links.",
