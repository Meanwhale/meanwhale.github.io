    "news_text": "A Danish podcast exposed the IUD scandal, where thousands of Greenlandic women were forced to have IUDs inserted as a form of birth control during the 1960s and 70s. Despite Greenland's status as a province rather than a colony post-1953, Denmark's policies aimed to control birth rates among the Inuit population. Survivors like Henriette Berthelsen have sought compensation and acknowledgment of the trauma caused. This scandal, along with a failed social experiment involving Greenlandic children, underscores Denmark's problematic historical relationship with Greenland. Calls for independence are growing among Greenlanders, especially in light of U.S. interest in the region, although Greenland's leadership emphasizes a desire for self-identity rather than assimilation.",
