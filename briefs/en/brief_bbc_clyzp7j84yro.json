    "news_original_title": "The Debate: Do Trump&#x27;s tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
    "news_text": "President Trump&#x27;s extensive tariffs are designed to protect American industries, generate revenue, and serve as bargaining tools. He has already imposed tariffs on China and plans to implement a 25% duty on steel and aluminum imports, with potential tariffs on Canada and Mexico. While some economists believe these tariffs could stimulate the US manufacturing sector, others warn they may disproportionately affect low-income Americans by raising consumer prices. The discussion highlights a shift from post-WWII trade policies and the potential for a global trade war, emphasizing the need for a new economic approach.",
