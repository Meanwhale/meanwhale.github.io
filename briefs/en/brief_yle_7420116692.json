    "news_text": "Norway's police security service PST has elevated its terrorism threat level from moderate to high, which is the second highest level. This decision is influenced by escalating conflicts in the Middle East. PST assesses that there is now a higher threat to Jewish and Israeli communities in Norway. Currently, there are no specific threats of terrorist acts identified, but the increase in threat level reflects an acknowledgment of the overall uncertain situation. The raised threat level will result in increased police patrols near 'vulnerable targets'.",
