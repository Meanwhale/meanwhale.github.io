    "news_text": "On October 1, Iran fired at least 180 missiles into Israel, escalating tensions and causing global oil prices to surge by about 5%. Brent crude traded above $75 a barrel the next day, following Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's vow to retaliate. The conflict could involve the U.S. and disrupt oil supplies, as Iran accounts for 4% of global oil output. Despite sanctions, Iran has managed to export oil, particularly to China, generating significant revenue. However, Iran's economy is struggling, with a GDP per capita significantly lower than Israel's. The Iranian government faces public discontent due to economic hardships, and a war with Israel could worsen the situation.",
