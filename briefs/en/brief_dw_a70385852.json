    "news_text": "On October 1, Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel, escalating tensions and causing global oil prices to rise by approximately 5%, the highest increase in a year. Brent crude traded above $75 a barrel following Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's vow to retaliate. Analysts warn that further escalation could involve the U.S. and disrupt oil supplies, as Iran accounts for about 4% of global oil output. Despite sanctions, Iran continues to export oil, primarily to China, and has reported significant revenues. However, Iran's economy is struggling, with a declining currency and a low GDP per capita compared to Israel. The regime faces internal discontent due to economic conditions and government corruption, and a potential war with Israel could exacerbate these issues.",
