    "news_text": "Lloyds Banking Group has increased its provisions for the car finance mis-selling scandal to \u00a31.2bn, affecting its profits. The bank set aside an additional \u00a3700m for potential compensation, on top of \u00a3450m previously allocated. Lloyds is facing scrutiny over unclear commission payments to car dealers, with millions of motorists potentially eligible for compensation. Despite this, CEO Charlie Nunn stated that the bank&#x27;s overall performance remains strong, reporting a pre-tax profit of \u00a35.97bn, down from \u00a37.5bn the previous year. The Supreme Court is set to rule on the adequacy of information provided to car loan customers regarding commission payments. Other banks have also made provisions for compensation related to motor finance.",
