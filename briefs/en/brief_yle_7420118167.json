    "news_text": "In a secret location in Ukraine, journalists are allowed to meet Russian prisoners of war, many of whom enlisted to avoid criminal convictions. The prisoners, primarily from the Kursk region, share their experiences of being wounded and captured during the conflict. Some, like Andrei, recount how they were abandoned by their units and later rescued by Ukrainian forces. Others, like Mikhail, discuss their motivations for joining the war, including escaping legal troubles and the promise of financial rewards. Despite initial fears of mistreatment, many prisoners report receiving decent treatment, including food and care. The Geneva Conventions govern the treatment of prisoners of war, and Ukraine is working to ensure their rights are respected. The situation highlights the complexities of the war, including the recruitment of soldiers from prisons and the broader implications for both Russian and Ukrainian forces.",
