    "news_original_title": "Serbia: Students mark 100 days since deadly canopy collapse",
    "news_text": "Protesters blocked roads across Serbia on Sunday, marking 100 days since the collapse of a canopy at a train station in Novi Sad that killed 15 people. Hundreds of students blocked a major highway in Belgrade for seven hours, honoring victims with a moment of silence and throwing roses into the river. The protests, driven by striking students, accuse the government of corruption related to the canopy&#x27;s renovation. Serbian officials initially denied work on the canopy, but later admitted alterations were made. The protests have led to resignations of key officials, and President Vucic has labeled them as an attempted &#x27;color revolution.&#x27; International attention is growing, with German lawmakers expressing concern over stability in the region.",
