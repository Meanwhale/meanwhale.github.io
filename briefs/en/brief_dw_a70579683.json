    "news_text": "Israel's military campaign against Hezbollah has shifted to targeting its financial infrastructure, specifically the Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association (AQAH), a financial institution linked to the group. Air strikes were conducted in Beirut, with Israeli officials claiming Hezbollah exploits Lebanon's financial crisis for its gain, relying on funds from Iran and local support. AQAH, established in 1983, has gained popularity amid Lebanon's banking collapse and is not regulated by the central bank. Experts note that Hezbollah's wealth comes from various sources, including crime, and while Israel's strikes may impact some of its finances, significant revenue streams remain intact. The ongoing economic crisis in Lebanon, exacerbated by sanctions and other factors, has led to a catastrophic situation for the country.",
