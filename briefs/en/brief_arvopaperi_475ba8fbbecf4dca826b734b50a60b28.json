    "news_text": "In February, the Michigan index of consumer confidence in the US dropped to 67.8, missing the Bloomberg forecast of 71.8. This decline follows January&#x27;s index of 71.1. Consumer inflation expectations rose to 4.3%, up from 3.3% previously. The increase in inflation expectations is attributed to a trade war and new import duties by President Trump. Consequently, the stock market saw declines, with the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq all down.",
