    "news_text": "Recent social media content claims that high cortisol levels from stress can lead to facial swelling. However, expert Atte Vad\u00e9n states that cortisol alone does not cause this effect in healthy people. Instead, lifestyle changes associated with stress, such as poor diet and lack of exercise, are more likely to contribute to facial changes. While certain medical conditions can lead to increased cortisol and facial swelling, normal stress reactions do not. Vad\u00e9n warns against quick-fix solutions presented in videos and emphasizes the importance of a healthy lifestyle.",
