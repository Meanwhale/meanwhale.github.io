    "news_text": "This article discusses the impact of AI on medical research and treatments, focusing on a case where 58-year-old Will Studholme was diagnosed with osteoporosis after an AI analysis of a CT scan conducted for food poisoning. The AI identified a collapsed vertebra, leading to early treatment that might not have been considered otherwise. The use of AI for opportunistic imaging is gaining traction, allowing for the detection of diseases like osteoporosis, heart disease, and diabetes during scans intended for other purposes. While this technology has the potential to improve early diagnosis and treatment, it also raises concerns about increased demand on healthcare resources and the need for confirmatory testing.",
