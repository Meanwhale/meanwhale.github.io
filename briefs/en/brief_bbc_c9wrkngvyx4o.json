    "news_text": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to announce an increase in the National Insurance rate for employers and lower the threshold for payments in the upcoming Budget, aiming to raise approximately \u00a320bn for public services, especially the NHS. This move is anticipated to be the largest revenue generator in the Budget, although other tax increases are also likely. Currently, employers pay 13.8% on earnings above \u00a3175 a week. The government is facing a \u00a322bn gap in public finances and is considering various tax adjustments, including freezing income tax thresholds and increasing taxes on asset sales. While the increase in National Insurance is seen as a tax on jobs, the government insists it will not burden 'working people.' Additionally, Reeves is expected to announce funding for affordable housing and address the housing crisis. Concerns have been raised about the impact of these tax changes on hiring and economic growth.",
