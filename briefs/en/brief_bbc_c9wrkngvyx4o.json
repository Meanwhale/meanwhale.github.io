    "news_text": "The Chancellor is expected to raise the National Insurance rate for employers to generate \u00a320 billion for public services, including the NHS, and may lower the threshold for when employers start paying the tax. This move is anticipated to be the largest revenue generator in the upcoming Budget, amidst other tax increases. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the need for tough decisions to support the NHS, while Labour's Rachel Reeves indicated that the increase would not affect employee contributions. The government is also considering changes to income tax thresholds, inheritance tax, and taxes on asset sales. There are concerns that raising National Insurance could hinder job creation and contradict Labour's commitment to not increase taxes on working people. The Chancellor's decisions are aimed at addressing a \u00a322 billion gap in public finances, but the implications for businesses and workers remain contentious.",
