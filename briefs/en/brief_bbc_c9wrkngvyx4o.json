    "news_text": "The Chancellor is set to raise National Insurance contributions for UK employers to generate \u00a320bn for public services, particularly the NHS. Rachel Reeves is expected to lower the threshold for employer tax payments but will likely not apply the levy to pension contributions. Currently, employers pay 13.8% on earnings above \u00a3175 a week. This change is anticipated to be the largest revenue generator in the upcoming Budget, amidst other expected tax increases. National Insurance is the second-largest revenue source in the UK, after income tax. There are concerns that raising this tax could hinder job creation and contradict Labour's manifesto promise not to increase taxes on working people. The government is also considering changes to inheritance tax and taxes on asset sales. The Chancellor has decided on major Budget measures, with a potential rise in National Insurance to 15.8% projected to raise around \u00a318bn annually. However, this could lead to reduced wage growth and impact corporate tax revenues. The Prime Minister has faced criticism for his definition of 'working people' in light of these tax changes.",
