    "news_text": "The disappearance of over 80 government critics in Kenya has led to significant public backlash. A judge has warned security officials of imprisonment for contempt of court if they fail to account for alleged abductions. The cases are linked to protests against tax hikes. While police deny involvement, the fear of state-sponsored abductions looms large. Some individuals, like Billy Mwangi, have reappeared but remain traumatized. Advocacy groups are pushing for accountability, yet no charges have been made against those responsible for the disappearances.",
