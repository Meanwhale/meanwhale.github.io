    "news_text": "In Panama, anticipation builds for the visit of US Foreign Minister Marco Rubio. Journalist Mika M\u00e4kel\u00e4inen has a video that counters President Trump's claims about US funding from the Panama Canal. M\u00e4kel\u00e4inen explains that payment criteria for using the canal are fixed and publicly available, based on cargo quantity and value. Daily auctions determine channel frequencies for those willing to pay the most. While Trump argues that Panama treats US vessels unfairly, Canal Authorities assert that the US fleet enjoys a privileged position, as it prioritizes quick passage through the canal. The video was filmed at the Pacific side of the Cocol\u00ed brackets, part of the Panama Canal expansion completed in 2016.",
