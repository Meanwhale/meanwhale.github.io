    "news_text": "Democrats are concerned that Kash Patel, an ally of Trump and known for promoting conspiracy theories, will use his position as FBI head to persecute political opponents. Patel has a history of criticizing the FBI and has labeled many individuals, including Democrats and some Republicans, as part of a &#x27;deep state&#x27; conspiracy. His recent book lists over 50 alleged conspirators, and he has vowed to reform the FBI, which he sees as corrupt. Critics worry that Patel&#x27;s leadership will lead to a politically motivated crackdown on dissenters, further consolidating Trump&#x27;s power.",
