    "news_text": "The UK government is set to unveil an Employment Rights Bill that seeks to improve workers' rights significantly, including the right to unpaid parental leave and stronger protections against unfair dismissal from the first day of employment. The bill, described by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner as the biggest upgrade in a generation, includes 28 measures, most of which will require further consultation and will not be implemented before autumn 2026. Key changes include removing the two-year qualifying period for unfair dismissal protections, benefiting around nine million workers, and introducing a new statutory probation period for new hires. While some unions have welcomed the proposals, business groups express concerns about their practical implications. The bill also addresses zero-hours contracts, requiring guaranteed-hours contracts based on hours worked over a 12-week period and ensuring reasonable notice for shift changes. Critics argue that the bill may create uncertainty for businesses, particularly smaller firms, while supporters see it as a necessary step towards fairer working conditions.",
