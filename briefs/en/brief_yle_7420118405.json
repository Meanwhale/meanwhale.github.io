    "news_text": "Defense ministers are convening in Brussels to address Ukraine's urgent need to end the war and to discuss NATO's support. Finland's Antti H\u00e4kk\u00e4nen will represent his country, while NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte emphasizes that Ukraine has not yet been invited to join NATO despite promises. Ukraine plans to unveil its victory plan, which includes long-range weapon usage. However, diplomatic sources express uncertainty about how this would aid Ukraine's war efforts. The ongoing conflict has led to territorial losses for Ukraine and military losses for Russia. Concerns about U.S. support amid upcoming presidential elections and domestic political instability in Europe complicate the situation. Despite these challenges, NATO continues to pledge support, including the delivery of fighter jets to Ukraine.",
