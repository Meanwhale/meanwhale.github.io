    "news_text": "A Lords inquiry has found that shoplifting is at unacceptable levels, with police forces needing to take immediate action. The crime is significantly under-reported, with actual incidents estimated at 17 million annually, while only 443,000 were recorded in the past year. The inquiry suggests easier crime reporting for retailers, increased funding for offender rehabilitation, and regulations to combat the sale of stolen goods online. The Home Office is making assaults on shop workers a criminal offense and deploying thousands of police officers to address the issue. The retail sector lost nearly \u00a32bn last year due to shoplifting, impacting prices for consumers. Recommendations have been made to the government to tackle the problem effectively.",
