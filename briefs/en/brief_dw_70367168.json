    "news_text": "As Claudia Sheinbaum takes office as Mexico's first female president on October 1, she faces significant challenges, including threats from US Republican candidate Donald Trump to impose higher tariffs on Mexican goods and calls for companies to relocate to the US. Sheinbaum inherits a growing economy but is confronted with a controversial judicial reform that raises concerns about increased organized crime influence on the judiciary. This has led to a freeze of $35 billion in US investments and skepticism among financial investors, reflected in a 13% drop in the Mexican currency's value. Despite these challenges, Sheinbaum's administration remains optimistic about attracting foreign direct investment, expecting $3 to $4 billion annually. German companies, crucial to Mexico's economy, are closely monitoring the situation, balancing concerns over judicial independence with the implications of US tariffs under the USMCA agreement.",
