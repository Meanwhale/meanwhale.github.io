    "news_text": "Erik and Lyle Menendez, who have been serving life sentences for the murder of their parents for over three decades, are closer to potential release after the Los Angeles County district attorney recommended their resentencing. The motion, which includes positive evaluations of the brothers' behavior in prison and their contributions to inmate programs, argues for a lesser sentence that would make them eligible for parole. The case has garnered significant public attention, including support from family members and celebrities, but also faces opposition from others who believe the brothers should remain incarcerated. A resentencing hearing is expected to be scheduled soon, and if successful, the case will then be reviewed by the California parole board. The brothers have maintained that they acted in self-defense due to years of abuse from their parents.",
