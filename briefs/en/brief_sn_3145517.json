    "news_text": "Astronomers have captured new 3-D observations of the supernova remnant Pa 30, associated with a stellar explosion seen from Earth in 1181. The remnant features unique spiky filaments that stretch three light-years, and their formation remains a mystery. Researchers suggest that shock waves from the explosion may have shaped the filaments. The study confirms that the remnant is likely from the 1181 event, with filaments tracing back to around 1152.",
