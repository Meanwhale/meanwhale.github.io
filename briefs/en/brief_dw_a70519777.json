    "news_text": "As EU member state leaders convene in Brussels, irregular migration is a key agenda item. European Council President Charles Michel emphasized the need for concrete measures to curb irregular migration, including stronger border controls and enhanced partnerships. Irregular crossings have decreased by over 40% in 2024 compared to last year. Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni highlighted a pragmatic approach, referencing a controversial deal for migrants in Albania. Concerns about migration are echoed by leaders like Poland's Donald Tusk, who suggested suspending asylum rights, and Germany's Olaf Scholz, who expressed skepticism about external reception centers. The rise of far-right parties advocating stricter immigration policies is influencing the political climate in Europe. Other topics at the summit include Russia's invasion of Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East.",
