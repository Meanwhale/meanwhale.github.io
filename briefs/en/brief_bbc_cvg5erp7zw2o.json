    "news_text": "BMW has postponed the reintroduction of electric vehicle production at its Oxford Mini plant, citing multiple uncertainties in the automotive industry. The company has decided against accepting a \u00a360m government grant while remaining in discussions about future plans. The UK automotive sector is engaged in ongoing debates with the government regarding electric vehicle production targets, with manufacturers arguing that expected sales figures are too ambitious. Despite the delay, BMW is progressing with investments to prepare the plant for future electric vehicle production, including constructing a new logistics facility. The UK government is aware of the challenges faced by car manufacturers and is consulting on reinstating the 2030 electric vehicle deadline while aiming to protect jobs.",
