    "news_text": "The UK government&#x27;s decision to remove tariffs on Chinese e-bikes has been criticized as detrimental to British manufacturing. While the move could save consumers money, UK-based e-bike companies fear a surge of cheap imports will harm their businesses. Business owners express frustration, stating they had invested in local manufacturing based on the previous tariff structure. The government maintains that the decision balances consumer savings with the protection of UK folding e-bike producers. The e-bike market has struggled post-Covid, and this change may exacerbate existing challenges.",
