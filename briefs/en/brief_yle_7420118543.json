    "news_text": "Petteri Orpo, the Minister of the European Union from Finland, asserts that EU law is essential for managing instrumental migration, as Finnish legislation alone is insufficient. He discussed this at an EU summit focused on migration, where Poland is considering a similar approach to Finland regarding asylum applications at its border with Belarus. Orpo supports Poland's initiative for EU-level legislation and has communicated with President Ursula von der Leyen about the issue. He noted that the situation involves a coordinated effort by Russia and Belarus to direct undocumented migrants towards the EU, which he views as an attack. The EU Commission is reviewing Finland's Conversion Act, which has faced criticism from human rights organizations. The summit also addressed the transfer of asylum processes to non-EU countries and the ongoing support for Ukraine amidst challenges from Hungary regarding aid packages. Orpo stressed the importance of a unified EU message to support Ukraine and highlighted Finland's recent conference on environmental issues involving Ukrainian leadership.",
