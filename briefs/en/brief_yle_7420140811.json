    "news_text": "The search for summer jobs peaks from January to March, with many employers seeking suitable candidates. The municipality of Nurmij\u00e4rvi has adopted a lottery system for selecting young summer workers, which aims to provide equal opportunities, especially since young applicants often lack extensive CVs. Other employers, like the telecommunications company DNA, also recruit without traditional CVs, focusing instead on knowledge and motivation. Despite some innovative approaches, many employers still prefer traditional recruitment methods. The overall summer job market appears slightly better this year compared to last, with an increase in job postings.",
