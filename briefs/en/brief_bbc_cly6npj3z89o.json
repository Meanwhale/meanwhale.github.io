    "news_text": "South Africa&#x27;s Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana postponed the national budget unveiling due to coalition disagreements over a proposed VAT increase, which would raise prices during a cost-of-living crisis. This unprecedented delay sent shockwaves through the country, causing the currency to plummet against the US dollar. The opposition criticized the government&#x27;s indecisiveness, while some coalition partners expressed surprise at the proposed hike. The budget is now set to be presented on March 12.",
