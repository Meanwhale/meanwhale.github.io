    "news_text": "Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announced a proposed tax of up to 100% on properties purchased by non-residents from outside the EU, citing a housing emergency. He emphasized the need to prevent a divide between wealthy landlords and poor tenants, as non-EU residents bought 27,000 properties in Spain in 2023 primarily for profit. The measure aims to prioritize housing for residents, although details on implementation and timeline remain unclear. Other proposed measures include tax exemptions for landlords offering affordable housing and stricter regulations on tourist rentals.",
