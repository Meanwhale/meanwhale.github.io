    "news_text": "On Thursday, hundreds of LGBTQ+ couples in Thailand married as the country's equal marriage law took effect, following decades of activism. The Marriage Equality Act positions Thailand as the first Southeast Asian nation and the third in Asia to legalize same-sex and transgender marriage, joining over 30 countries worldwide. Former Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin celebrated the day as significant for many Thais. LGBTQ+ groups aimed for 1,448 wedding registrations, symbolizing the fight for marriage rights for all genders. The law uses gender-neutral terms to include transgender individuals and grants full legal rights to LGBTQ+ couples. Despite public support for equal marriage, LGBTQ+ individuals still face discrimination in daily life.",
