    "news_text": "Indonesia's newly sworn-in president, Prabowo Subianto, has inaugurated 48 ministers and established 22 new ministries, aiming to create a strong government. This restructuring has sparked debate over potential bureaucracy and inefficiency, especially as Indonesia now has a larger cabinet compared to its neighbors. Subianto's coalition controls 82% of parliamentary seats, raising concerns about the absence of opposition, which is vital for a healthy democracy. Analysts warn that a bloated cabinet could strain the state budget and hinder foreign investment, potentially undermining Subianto's goal of increasing economic growth from 5.05% to 8%.",
