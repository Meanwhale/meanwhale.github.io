    "news_text": "President Trump's decision to suspend development aid has halted US-funded projects in around 130 countries, leading to dire consequences for millions globally. He accused USAID of wastefulness without evidence, prompting criticism from opposition politicians who argue this jeopardizes the fight against hunger and disease. The US and China are in a competition for global influence, particularly in countries like Bangladesh, which relies heavily on US aid. The halt in funding is causing significant issues in Bangladesh, with calls for diversifying funding sources. Experts warn that the collapse of US development aid could lead to increased global instability and migration. The situation is expected to be a key topic at the upcoming Munich Security Conference.",
