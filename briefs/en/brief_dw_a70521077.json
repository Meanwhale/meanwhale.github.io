    "news_text": "The European Central Bank (ECB) has reduced its benchmark interest rate from 3.5% to 3.25%, marking the third rate cut this year. This decision follows a report indicating that year-on-year inflation in the eurozone decreased to 1.7% in September, the first time it has fallen below the ECB's 2% target in over three years. The decline in inflation is attributed to a 6.1% drop in energy costs compared to the previous year. ECB officials, including French central bank governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau, have expressed optimism about controlling inflation, while also acknowledging the need to address weak economic growth in the eurozone, which is projected to slow to 0.2% in the third quarter and 0.8% for 2024.",
