    "news_text": "The European Central Bank (ECB) has reduced its benchmark interest rate from 3.5% to 3.25%, marking the third cut this year. The rates on the deposit facility, main financing operations, and marginal lending facility were all lowered by 25 basis points. This decision follows a report indicating that year-on-year inflation in the eurozone dropped to 1.7% in September, the first time it fell below the ECB's 2% target in over three years. The decline in inflation is attributed to a decrease in energy costs. ECB officials, including French central bank governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau, have indicated that further cuts may be forthcoming as the bank shifts its focus to addressing weak economic growth in the eurozone, which is projected to slow significantly in the coming quarters.",
