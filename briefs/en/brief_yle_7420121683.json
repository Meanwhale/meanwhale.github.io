    "news_text": "Research by Aija Ko.la highlights the responsibility of dog owners for their pets' welfare. The study reveals a strong emotional bond between dogs and owners, demonstrated by synchronized heart rates. It suggests that the owner's emotional state can directly influence the dog's well-being. When owners are relaxed, their dogs tend to be relaxed as well, regardless of the dog's activity level. The study emphasizes the reciprocal relationship between dogs and owners, showing that a dog's emotional state can affect the owner more than previously understood. The findings were published in Scientific Reports on October 24, 2015.",
