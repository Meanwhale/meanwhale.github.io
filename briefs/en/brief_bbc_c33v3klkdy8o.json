    "news_text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that E. coli bacteria, which can cause severe stomach issues, has been found in McDonald's Quarter Pounder sandwiches. There have been 49 reported cases of illness in 10 states, with 10 hospitalizations and one death. The CDC is investigating the source of contamination, suspecting slivered onions as the likely culprit. McDonald's has removed the affected ingredients from their supply and is temporarily pulling the sandwich from menus in some states. The company is cooperating with investigators and emphasizes its commitment to food safety. E. coli can cause symptoms like severe diarrhea and vomiting, and this is not the first outbreak linked to McDonald's.",
