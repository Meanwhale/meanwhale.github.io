    "news_text": "North Korea has launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that flew for 86 minutes, marking the longest flight recorded to date. The missile reached an altitude of 7,000 km, indicating it could have traveled further if launched horizontally. This launch violates UN sanctions and occurs during heightened tensions between North and South Korea, with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un stating it demonstrates their resolve to respond to perceived threats. The US condemned the launch as a serious violation of multiple UN resolutions, while South Korea announced it would impose new sanctions in response. The launch follows reports of North Korean troops being sent to Russia to support its military efforts in Ukraine.",
