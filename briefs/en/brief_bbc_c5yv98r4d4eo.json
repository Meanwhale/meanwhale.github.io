    "news_text": "Doctors are warning women to be careful when using menstrual cups after a case where a woman developed temporary kidney problems because the cup was misaligned. The patient had been suffering from pelvic pain and blood in her urine but did not connect these symptoms to the menstrual cup. Proper positioning and size selection of the cup are crucial to avoid negative effects on the urinary tract. Menstrual cups, which are reusable and sustainable, can hold significant amounts of blood and require proper insertion and removal techniques. First-time users may find them challenging, and it&#x27;s important to consult healthcare professionals if issues arise.",
