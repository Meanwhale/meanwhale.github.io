    "news_text": "Becoming president of the US requires substantial financial resources, which candidates can obtain through personal funds, private donations, PACs, or government funding. Kamala Harris has raised over $1.27 billion for her campaign, while Donald Trump has raised just under $940 million. The funding landscape has changed since the 2010 Supreme Court ruling that allowed unlimited corporate and union donations through super PACs, leading to concerns about corruption and access to politicians. With 34 Senate seats and all House seats up for election, candidates have collectively raised significant amounts for their campaigns. The spending patterns in previous elections indicate a heavy focus on advertising, which is expected to continue in 2024.",
