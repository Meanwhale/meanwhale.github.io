Kamala Harris has raised over $1.27 billion, while Donald Trump has raised just under $940 million, highlighting the importance of financial backing in elections.",
    "news_text": "Becoming president of the US requires substantial financial resources, which candidates can obtain through personal funds, private donations, PACs, or government funding, though the latter is often avoided due to spending limits. As of September 30, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris has raised over $1.27 billion, with significant contributions from large donors, while Republican candidate Donald Trump has raised just under $940 million, heavily relying on wealthy supporters. Despite being outspent in previous elections, Trump won in 2016 and lost in 2020, illustrating that while money is crucial, it does not guarantee victory. The current election cycle sees all Senate and House seats contested, with candidates collectively raising billions. Campaign finance laws restrict contributions to US citizens and impose limits on donations, but the 2010 Supreme Court ruling allowed unlimited corporate and union funding through super PACs, raising concerns about potential corruption and the influence of wealthy donors. Campaign spending is primarily directed towards advertising, particularly in swing states, reflecting the strategic allocation of resources in close elections.",
