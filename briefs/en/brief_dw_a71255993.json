    "news_header": "The text discusses the recent tensions between the US and Canada, focusing on Trump's rhetoric and proposed tariffs, which could disrupt trade and impact both economies.",
    "news_text": "The article highlights the satirical song 'Blame Canada!' from 'South Park,' drawing parallels to Donald Trump's recent blame on Canada for issues like illegal migration and drug trafficking. Following his re-election, Trump threatened 25% tariffs on Canadian imports, joking about annexing Canada. Analysts express concern over Trump's unexpected focus on Canada, which was not a major target during the election. Despite the US-Canada trade being extensive, Trump claims Canada is not meeting terms of the USMCA. Canadian leaders warn that tariffs could harm both economies, and potential retaliation on US imports is being considered. The article concludes that while Trump's threats may cause short-term disruptions, Canada will endure beyond his presidency.",
