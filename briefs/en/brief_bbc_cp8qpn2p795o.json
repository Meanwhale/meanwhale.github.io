    "news_text": "Residents of Santorini are facing a severe seismic crisis with thousands of earthquakes recorded, leading to the evacuation of about 75% of the population. Authorities declared a state of emergency after a significant 5.2 magnitude quake. Experts are puzzled by the unusual pattern of quakes, which do not follow typical aftershock sequences. The island, located on the Hellenic Volcanic Arc, has not seen a major eruption since the 1950s. While some residents remain unfazed, others are preparing for potential further seismic activity.",
