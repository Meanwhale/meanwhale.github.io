    "news_header": "The race for the White House is tightly contested with both candidates, Trump and Harris, having viable paths to victory. Key issues include the economy, abortion rights, and immigration, with voter turnout being crucial.",
    "news_text": "As the presidential election approaches, the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is deadlocked, with polls showing both candidates within the margin of error. The economy remains the top concern for voters, despite low unemployment and a booming stock market, as many Americans struggle with rising prices. Trump is leveraging his stable support and focusing on immigration, while Harris aims to position herself as a candidate for change and stability. The election is historic, with the potential for a former president to be re-elected after a defeat, and the issue of abortion rights is expected to drive turnout in favor of Harris. The election is projected to be the most expensive ever, with Harris currently leading in fundraising and ad spending.",
