    "news_text": "The UK government plans to convince Donald Trump's administration that imposing large tariffs on UK exports to the US is unnecessary, as there is no goods trade deficit. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds emphasized that the US does not import more from the UK than it exports. This comes amid Trump's threats of high tariffs on imports from various countries. Additionally, Reynolds mentioned the possibility of the UK adopting EU rules for food and farm products to facilitate trade with Europe, which aligns with the EU's suggestion of dynamic alignment on standards. However, there is concern within the Conservative Party regarding any potential new agreements that may tie the UK to the EU.",
