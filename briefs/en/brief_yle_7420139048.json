    "news_text": "Last year, extreme weather events disrupted the education of 242 million children across 85 countries, with South Asia facing the most significant challenges, impacting 128 million pupils. Heat waves were the primary cause of school closures, and children are particularly vulnerable to these crises. UNICEF highlights that extreme weather can damage schools, complicate travel, and create dangerous learning conditions.
