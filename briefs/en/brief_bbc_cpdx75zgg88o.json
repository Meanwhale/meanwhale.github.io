    "news_text": "Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has turned down a $97.4bn takeover bid from a consortium led by Elon Musk. Musk&#x27;s attorney confirmed the bid for all assets of OpenAI, which has been at the center of a long-standing conflict between Musk and Altman regarding the startup&#x27;s direction. Altman humorously responded on Musk&#x27;s platform X, suggesting a counter-offer to buy Twitter. While Altman&#x27;s rejection doesn&#x27;t end the takeover possibility, OpenAI&#x27;s board will ultimately decide. Musk and Altman co-founded OpenAI in 2015, but their relationship has deteriorated since Musk&#x27;s departure in 2018. Altman is restructuring OpenAI into a for-profit entity, which Musk argues contradicts its original mission. The bid is significantly lower than OpenAI&#x27;s recent valuations, and Musk&#x27;s motives are questioned, especially as he has a competing for-profit AI venture. Additionally, Musk is involved in a new $500bn AI infrastructure project with Oracle and other investors, announced by Trump as a major initiative for the US.",
