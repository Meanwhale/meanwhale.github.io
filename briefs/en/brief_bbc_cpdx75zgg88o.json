    "news_text": "A consortium of investors led by Elon Musk has made a $97.4 billion bid to take over OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. This move highlights ongoing tensions between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman regarding the future of the company. Altman responded to the bid humorously on Musk&#x27;s platform, X. OpenAI, co-founded by Musk in 2015, is transitioning to a for-profit model, which Musk argues deviates from its original mission. The bid is supported by Musk&#x27;s AI company xAI and several private equity firms. Musk aims to return OpenAI to its open-source roots. The bid is significantly lower than OpenAI&#x27;s recent valuation of $157 billion.",
