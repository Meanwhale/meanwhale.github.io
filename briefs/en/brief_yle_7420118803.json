    "news_text": "According to intelligence and satellite images, North Korea has dispatched 12,000 troops to Russia to assist in the Ukraine war, as reported by South Korean news agency Yonhap. These troops, which include special forces, have already left North Korea and are now in military bases in the Far East of Russia, where they are being trained before deployment to the front lines in Ukraine. They have been provided with Russian uniforms, weapons, and fake IDs. North Korea has also supplied Russia with ammunition, anti-tank rockets, and ballistic missiles. South Korea has utilized artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology to identify these North Korean soldiers. This marks the first instance of North Korea sending troops to participate in a foreign conflict, as the country has been supporting Russia's actions since the onset of the war.",
