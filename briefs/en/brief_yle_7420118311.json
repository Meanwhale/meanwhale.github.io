    "news_text": "Ilmari Reunam\u00e4ki argues that if Donald Trump wins the upcoming elections, it will be largely due to his immigration policy. Trump's campaign has focused on the mass expulsion of undocumented immigrants, which resonates with a significant portion of the electorate, particularly Republicans. Recent surveys indicate that attitudes towards immigration have become increasingly negative, with many Americans supporting strict measures, including the construction of a border wall and the expulsion of undocumented individuals. Trump's clear stance contrasts with Kamala Harris's more ambiguous approach to immigration, and he has gained popularity for his hardline policies. The text also reflects on the historical context of U.S. immigration policy and suggests that Trump's understanding of the economic implications of immigration could be a decisive factor in the elections.",
