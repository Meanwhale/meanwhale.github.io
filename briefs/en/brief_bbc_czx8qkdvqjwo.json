    "news_text": "Ten endangered flamingos have been saved after smugglers were caught attempting to traffic them out of Tunisia. The birds were found crammed into crates and were rescued near the Algerian border. They have now been returned to their natural habitat as part of conservation efforts. It remains unclear what actions will be taken against the smugglers. Flamingos are protected by Tunisian law, and threats to their population include pollution and climate change. Despite these challenges, recent data shows a slight increase in their population, with at least half a million remaining in the wild.",
