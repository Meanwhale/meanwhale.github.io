    "news_text": "The Trump administration's directive to freeze federal grants and aid was rescinded after a federal judge temporarily blocked it. This freeze, which was implemented on Tuesday, disrupted funding across various sectors including healthcare and education, raising concerns about a constitutional crisis. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) had sent out a memo with controversial questions regarding gender ideology and abortion. Although the memo was rescinded, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the funding freeze itself remains in effect. A federal judge in Rhode Island was set to consider a request from several states for a temporary restraining order against the policy, which they argued was implemented with little notice and could severely impact their budgets. Meanwhile, President Trump warned federal employees that those who do not return to work next week will be fired.",
