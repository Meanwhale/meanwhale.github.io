    "news_text": "Astronomers have observed starlight from a galaxy hosting the quasar ULAS J1120+0641, which is 13 billion light-years away. The black hole at its center has a mass of 1.4 billion solar masses, making it 54% of the total stellar mass of its host galaxy, a record ratio. This discovery was made using the James Webb Space Telescope after previous attempts with the Hubble Space Telescope failed. The quasar outshines its galaxy by over 100 times, complicating measurements of the galaxy's light. The findings suggest that the coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies in the early universe differs significantly from modern galaxies.",
