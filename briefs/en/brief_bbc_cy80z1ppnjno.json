    "news_text": "After over six weeks of protests in Martinique against high living costs, local authorities signed an agreement to reduce food prices by an average of 20% for 6,000 imported products. However, the Rally for the Protection of Afro-Caribbean Peoples and Resources (RPPRAC), the group leading the protests, rejected the deal, calling for a broader price reduction covering 40,000 products. The protests, which have resulted in four deaths and significant unrest, highlight the disparity in food prices between Martinique and mainland France, where costs are about 40% lower. The high prices are attributed to factors such as a 9% import tax and numerous intermediaries. The situation has escalated to include curfews and police intervention.",
