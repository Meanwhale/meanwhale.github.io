    "news_text": "Sharone Lifschitz, from east London, held onto hope for her father Oded&#x27;s return after he was taken hostage by Hamas for over 500 days. A peace activist and friend to Palestinians, Oded was killed in captivity, with his body returned to his family. His wife Yocheved, also a hostage but released alive, faced the tragedy of not reuniting with her husband of 63 years. The Israeli Prime Minister&#x27;s Office confirmed Oded was murdered by the Islamic Jihad. Sharone, a filmmaker, expressed her grief and highlighted the trauma faced by hostage families. Oded was known for his humanitarian work, including driving sick Palestinians to hospitals. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer expressed condolences, recognizing Oded&#x27;s dedication to peace. The ongoing conflict has resulted in significant civilian casualties, with Israel&#x27;s military response leading to thousands of Palestinian deaths. The Lifschitz family can now mourn Oded, but after 503 days of uncertainty, they had hoped for a different outcome.",
