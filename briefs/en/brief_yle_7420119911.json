    "news_text": "The City of Tampere has set a regulation that limits apartments to being rented out no more than ten times a year. Entrepreneur Maiju Saukkola, who has been renting out his apartments on Airbnb for four years, faced scrutiny after a report was made about his rentals. Despite having no complaints from tenants or neighbors, the city has tightened conditions for short-term rentals while also encouraging them during events due to a shortage of accommodation. Saukkola plans to shift to long-term rentals after the Airbnb restrictions, highlighting the challenges faced by workers needing affordable lodging. He notes that all types of rentals can encounter issues, including disturbances from tenants.",
