    "news_original_title": "Yhdysvaltain valtionhallinnon ty\u00f6ntekij\u00e4t haastamassa Trumpin hallintoa oikeuteen kehitysapuviraston rampauttamisesta",
    "news_text": "The complaint argues that the dissolution of USAID is beyond the jurisdiction of President Trump, citing a 1998 regulation that guarantees the agency's independence. The largest trade union of government employees and an international union have sued the Trump administration to reverse its decision to dismantle USAID. The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in Washington, seeks to prevent the administration from making decisions about the agency's future, restore its funding, and reopen its offices. The complaint also highlights the impact of external aid payment freezes and restructuring efforts, which have led to layoffs and operational disruptions within USAID. The Trump administration reportedly plans to reduce the agency's staff to around 300, down from over 10,000 worldwide, exacerbating a global humanitarian crisis.",
