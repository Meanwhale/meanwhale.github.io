    "news_text": "During the election campaign, J.D. Vance, the Republican vice presidential candidate, has been hesitant to directly address the outcome of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. In a recent event in Pennsylvania, he reiterated that he had answered the question about whether Donald Trump lost the election 'a million times' but ultimately stated 'No,' while avoiding the term 'lost.' Vance acknowledged there were serious problems in the 2020 election but refrained from labeling it as fraudulent. His comments come amid ongoing discussions about the legitimacy of the election, especially following the Capitol riot in 2021. Vance has also focused on future issues rather than the past election in previous interviews.",
