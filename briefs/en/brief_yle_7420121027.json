It will utilize green hydrogen for steel production instead of fossil fuels. The CEO, Mark Bula, expresses concern over potential delays affecting contracts and project credibility. While the plant promises substantial job creation and tax revenue, local opposition has emerged, with 400 residents signing a petition against it. The upcoming municipal elections may further influence the project's future.",
