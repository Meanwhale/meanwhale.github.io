    "news_header": "The ECB has decided to lower its interest rates, which is beneficial for Finnish mortgage holders.",
    "news_text": "Christine Lagarde's press conference on interest rates will begin at 15:45. The European Central Bank (ECB) has lowered its deposit interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, bringing it down from 3.5% to 3.25%. This decision is expected to positively impact Finnish mortgage holders, as the central bank's rates influence loan interest rates. Analysts predict further rate reductions in the future, with the possibility of the deposit rate falling to 3% before the new year. Inflation in the eurozone has slowed to 1.8%, but varies significantly across member countries, with Finland experiencing one of the lowest inflation rates. The ECB's decisions are often inferred from the President's speeches, and recent comments suggest a trend towards lower rates. The impact of ECB rate changes is felt more quickly in Finland compared to other eurozone countries due to the common practice of tying loans to euribor rates.",
