    "news_text": "Giovanny Aldama Garcia was arrested for allegedly tying his dog, originally named Jumbo and now renamed Trooper, to a post in floodwaters before Hurricane Milton. The dog was rescued by Highway Patrol on October 9, and bodycam footage of the rescue gained over 12 million views. Garcia claimed he abandoned the dog because he was leaving Florida and couldn't find anyone to care for him. He later attempted to reclaim the dog at an animal shelter. If convicted of animal cruelty, he could face up to five years in prison. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis condemned the act, stating it was unacceptable to leave a dog tied up during a storm. Trooper has since received numerous adoption inquiries after being cared for by the Leon County Humane Society.",
