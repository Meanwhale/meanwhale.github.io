    "news_text": "Giovanny Aldama Garcia was arrested for allegedly tying his dog, originally named Jumbo and now renamed Trooper, to a post in floodwaters before Hurricane Milton. The dog was rescued by Highway Patrol on October 9, and bodycam footage of the rescue gained over 12 million views. Garcia claimed he abandoned the dog due to the storm and his inability to find care for it. He later attempted to reclaim Trooper at an animal shelter but agreed to surrender ownership. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis condemned the act, stating it was 'totally unacceptable.' Trooper has since gained significant public attention, with hundreds inquiring about his adoption. Hurricane Milton caused widespread flooding and resulted in at least 24 fatalities.",
