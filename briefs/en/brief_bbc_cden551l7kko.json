    "news_text": "The 2023 hurricane season has been notably active, with Hurricanes Helene and Milton emerging after a period of low storm activity. The season began with Hurricane Beryl, the earliest category five hurricane on record, and has since seen nine hurricanes, surpassing typical annual totals. Despite warm Atlantic waters, the season experienced a lull in activity due to unfavorable atmospheric conditions influenced by the West African monsoon and Saharan dust. However, as conditions improved, six tropical storms formed rapidly, with five becoming hurricanes, including Milton, which intensified dramatically. Climate change has been linked to the increased intensity and rapid formation of these storms, highlighting the growing risks associated with warmer ocean temperatures. Forecasters are monitoring potential further developments, but the season has already underscored the impact of climate change on hurricane activity.",
