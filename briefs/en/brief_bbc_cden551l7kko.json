    "news_header": "The 2024 hurricane season has been marked by an unusual pattern of storm formation, with Hurricanes Helene and Milton causing significant damage in the southeastern US after a period of fewer storms despite warm ocean temperatures.",
    "news_text": "This hurricane season has been exceptionally busy, with five hurricanes forming in less than two weeks, contrasting with a slow start in early September. The season began with Hurricane Beryl, the earliest category five hurricane on record, and has since seen nine hurricanes, two more than average. Despite warm Atlantic waters, other atmospheric conditions hindered storm development until late September, when six storms rapidly intensified, including Helene and Milton. Climate change has exacerbated storm intensity, with scientists noting that warmer oceans increase the likelihood of stronger hurricanes. The season's activity may continue, influenced by high sea temperatures and potential La Ni\u00f1a effects, but predicting further developments remains complex.",
