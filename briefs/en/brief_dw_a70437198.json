    "news_text": "The German economy is currently struggling, with Economy Minister Robert Habeck announcing a projected GDP contraction of 0.2% in 2024, marking a second consecutive year of recession. This downturn is attributed to both internal structural problems and external pressures from global powers like China and the U.S. The business climate is deteriorating, as indicated by a decline in the ifo Institute's business climate index. Companies are increasingly seeking foreign partnerships or takeovers, with notable cases like Deutsche Bahn selling its logistics subsidiary and potential takeovers of Commerzbank by UniCredit. The overall sentiment among economists is that Germany's stagnation and bureaucratic hurdles are driving away foreign investment, and while some government efforts have been made to improve the business environment, significant changes are still needed. Experts argue that enhancing competitiveness is crucial for economic recovery, and that current government interventions may not be sufficient to stimulate growth.",
