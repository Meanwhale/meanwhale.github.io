    "news_header": "UK pubs face potential closures without extension of business rates relief, warns Stonegate Group CEO.",
    "news_text": "David McDowall, CEO of Stonegate Group, has warned that widespread pub closures could occur unless the Chancellor extends business rates relief in the upcoming Budget. Currently, landlords earn only 12p profit per pint, and the relief, set to expire in April, has been crucial for their survival since its introduction during the Covid pandemic. The removal of this relief could quadruple business rates for small pubs, exacerbating existing financial pressures from inflation and rising costs. Industry representatives have urged the Chancellor to extend the relief, highlighting the significant financial burden that would result from its removal, which could cost the hospitality and retail sectors an additional \u00a32.5 billion. The Treasury has stated its commitment to support businesses through reforms to the business rates system.",
