    "news_text": "The Treasury has indicated it will modify its self-imposed debt rule to enable borrowing for new infrastructure projects. Chief Secretary Darren Jones announced that independent checks will be implemented to ensure efficient spending and prevent a repeat of the financial turmoil experienced after the 2022 mini-Budget under former Prime Minister Liz Truss. The government aims to establish 'guardrails' for infrastructure spending, which will include expert-led oversight and a new National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority to manage a 10-year strategy for major projects. This approach seeks to depoliticize infrastructure decisions and provide independent quality control to improve public services and investment outcomes. The changes come as the government prepares for the upcoming Budget and faces scrutiny over spending decisions.",
