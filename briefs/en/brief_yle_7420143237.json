    "news_header": "Last autumn, Nordea experienced hacker attacks that damaged trust, but no accounts were compromised. The incident raised concerns in the stock brokerage sector, especially with Nordnet, where customer portfolios were accessible. A Finnish customer&#x27;s shares worth over EUR 7,000 were attempted to be sold but the transaction was canceled. Despite no damages being paid, Nordnet may face significant penalties from Swedish financial and data protection authorities, potentially amounting to EUR 20 million. Legal experts emphasize that negligence does not absolve responsibility, and the incident could impact Nordnet&#x27;s customer trust and growth targets, despite only affecting a few hundred customers directly.",
