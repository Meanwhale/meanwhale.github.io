This mistake has caused economic and industrial waste water to mix with toilet water for nine years. Additionally, industrial waste water from a newly installed flue-gas scrubber has also been improperly directed into the toilet drain. The situation was rectified upon detection, and authorities have been notified for further investigation.",
