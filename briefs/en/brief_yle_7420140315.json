    "news_text": "Tesla announced lower than expected profits and called for lower vehicle prices, reporting a profit of around $2.3 billion for October-December, down 71% from the previous year. Net sales grew by 2% to approximately $25.7 billion, but both results and turnover fell short of analysts' expectations. Tesla's car sales decreased by 1% to just under 1.8 million vehicles amid fierce competition. Despite these challenges, Tesla's stock rose 4% on the secondary market. The company expects growth in 2025 with new products and a potential robot taxi project. Meanwhile, Meta and Microsoft also reported significant profits and plans for investments in AI and cloud services.",
