    "news_text": "The Treasury had concerns that the ruling could limit car loan availability and respected the court&#x27;s decision to block its intervention. The FCA previously banned commission-based deals, leading to potential compensation claims totaling millions. The government aims to ensure customer redress while maintaining competitiveness in the motor sector. The court rejected other intervention applications but approved those from the FCA and the National Franchised Dealers Association.",
