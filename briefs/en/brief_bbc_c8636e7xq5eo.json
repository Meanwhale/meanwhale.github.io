    "news_text": "The Court of Appeal previously ruled that lenders needed to be clearer, but they are appealing this decision. The Treasury, concerned about the impact on car loan availability, attempted to intervene but respected the court&#x27;s decision. The FCA banned commission-based deals in 2021, leading to potential compensation claims that could total \u00a330bn. The government wants to ensure customer redress while maintaining the competitiveness of UK banks.",
