    "news_text": "Germany's IG Metall union began strikes in the metal and electrical sectors early Tuesday, coinciding with collective bargaining for approximately 3.9 million workers in the automotive and manufacturing industries. Strikes were reported at the Volkswagen plant in Osnabr\u00fcck and other companies in Hildesheim. The union is demanding a 7% wage increase over 12 months, while employers have offered 3.6% over 27 months. The negotiations are influenced by Volkswagen's plans to close three plants and cut jobs. Nationwide protests are planned, particularly at the Osnabr\u00fcck plant, which is at risk of closure.",
