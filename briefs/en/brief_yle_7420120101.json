    "news_text": "According to the New York Times, Iran is attempting to avoid war but has ordered its military to prepare for retaliation against Israel. Iranian officials report that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has instructed the military to develop several plans for potential attacks. Iran has been on full defense and has bolstered its air defenses around military and nuclear sites. The response to Israeli attacks will depend on their intensity; targeted strikes may not provoke a significant response, but attacks resulting in high-ranking official casualties could lead to a massive counterattack. Iran is considering launching ballistic missiles and increasing operations against Iran-backed groups in the region, as well as disrupting international energy supplies. Additionally, Iran is working to strengthen ties with Arab states while warning Israel of potential consequences.",
