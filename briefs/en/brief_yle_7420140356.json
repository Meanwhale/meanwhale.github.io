    "news_text": "The government's desired economic growth has not materialized, with weak employment trends and strikes occurring. Global tensions are heightened due to actions from Russia, China, and the United States. However, positive news from companies such as Nordea, Nokia, and Machine suggests potential for growth. The CEO of Varman, Risto Murto, is exploring new economic strategies. The unpredictability of U.S. President Donald Trump adds to the uncertainty, though it may also present opportunities for Finland, such as the potential establishment of an icebreaker fleet. Jyri H\u00e4\u00e4h\u00e4m\u00e4man, CEO of the Confederation of Finnish Industries, will discuss these topics in a live broadcast.",
