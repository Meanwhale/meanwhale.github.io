    "news_text": "Anna Engomba discovered she was HIV positive in 2006 but kept it a secret due to stigma. She faced significant challenges, including dropping out of school and difficulties accessing medication. Despite the high number of HIV cases in Namibia, advancements in treatment, such as antiretroviral drugs and preventative therapies, have improved outcomes. The country has made strides in reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. New drugs like lenacapavir show promise for prevention, but access remains a challenge, especially for marginalized groups. Stigma continues to hinder treatment access, despite available services.",
