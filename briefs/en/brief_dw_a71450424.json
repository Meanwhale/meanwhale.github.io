    "news_original_title": "Gaza: German-Israeli hostage Arbel Yehoud to be released",
    "news_text": "As Palestinians return to their homes in northern Gaza, Israelis await the release of hostages, including Arbel Yehoud, who was kidnapped during a Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. Although she was supposed to be released last Saturday, Hamas instead freed four female Israeli soldiers. Israel halted the return of Palestinians in response to this violation of the ceasefire. Yehoud's family has been anxiously waiting for her return for nearly 16 months. She was working as a visitor chaperone before her abduction and has been in contact with her family during her captivity. The ongoing negotiations have led to a temporary ceasefire, with plans for more hostage exchanges.",
