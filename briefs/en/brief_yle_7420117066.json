    "news_text": "The comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS will be visible in the evening sky, especially on the night between Saturday and Sunday. Clear weather is expected, particularly in western areas and Lapland. While the comet will be visible for several weeks, its brightness may vary, making predictions uncertain. Observers should look towards the western horizon right after sunset and use binoculars for better detail, while ensuring not to look at the sun through them. The comet may appear dimmer than other famous comets, and capturing a good photo requires a proper camera.",
