Her journey from prosecutor to vice president has been marked by challenges, including her handling of immigration and reproductive rights.",
    "news_text": "Kamala Harris joined Joe Biden as his running mate in August 2020, aiming to defeat Donald Trump and restore normalcy in the U.S. After Biden's poor debate performance and subsequent decision to end his reelection campaign in July 2024, Harris was confirmed as the Democratic candidate. Born to immigrant parents, Harris rose through the political ranks, becoming California's attorney general and later a U.S. senator. Her tenure has been marked by mixed reviews, particularly regarding her approach to law enforcement and immigration. Following the Supreme Court's repeal of Roe v. Wade, Harris has emerged as a strong advocate for reproductive rights. As she campaigns against Trump, she emphasizes democracy and reproductive freedoms, though polls indicate a competitive race ahead of the November 2024 election.",
