    "news_original_title": "Trump's Tariffs and Their Impact on Auto ETFs",
    "news_text": "President Trump's decision to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese imports is expected to have limited effects on U.S. vehicle imports but could significantly impact auto parts, potentially increasing consumer vehicle prices. The U.S. imports $15.4 billion to $17.5 billion in transportation goods from China annually, with about $9 billion to $10 billion in auto parts. Ford and GM are likely to be the most affected, as their China-made models constitute a large portion of imports. While vehicle imports from China are minimal, auto parts imports are substantial, and many U.S. electric vehicles rely on Chinese components. If automakers pass on increased costs to consumers, it could negatively affect sales, which are already high. The situation also highlights the importance of certain ETFs focused on the automotive sector.",
