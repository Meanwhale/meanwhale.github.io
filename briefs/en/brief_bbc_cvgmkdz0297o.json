    "news_text": "The Doomsday Clock, which indicates how close humanity is to destruction, has been moved forward by one second to 89 seconds to midnight, the closest it has ever been. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists cited nuclear threats, potential misuse of biological and AI advancements, and climate change as key factors. Daniel Holz, chair of the Bulletin's Science and Security Board, emphasized that this change serves as a warning to world leaders. The clock was initially set at seven minutes to midnight in 1947 and remained unchanged at 90 seconds last year. The BAS highlighted ongoing global conflicts, particularly in Ukraine and the Middle East, and the poor prognosis for climate change efforts. They also noted the dangers posed by emerging diseases and disruptive technologies, especially those involving AI in military applications. The spread of misinformation further exacerbates these threats, with the US, China, and Russia being urged to take responsibility in preventing global catastrophe.",
