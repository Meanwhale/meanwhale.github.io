    "news_text": "The culture secretary plans to address concerns with BBC executives regarding a documentary on Gaza narrated by the son of a Hamas official. The BBC has faced criticism over the film, which features a 13-year-old boy linked to Hamas&#x27;s deputy agriculture minister. The broadcaster stated it was unaware of this connection prior to airing and has since apologized for not disclosing it. A new message has been added to the program on iPlayer to clarify the family link. Prominent figures have called for an investigation into the BBC&#x27;s editorial standards and compliance with broadcasting regulations. The BBC maintains that it followed its usual procedures but acknowledges the need for transparency. The culture secretary emphasizes the importance of accurately sourcing individuals featured in such sensitive content.",
