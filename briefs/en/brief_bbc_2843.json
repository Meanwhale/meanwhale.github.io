    "news_header": "Transport Secretary signals HS2 railway line extension to London Euston, emphasizing the need for a central terminus.",
    "news_text": "Transport Secretary Louise Haigh indicated that the HS2 railway line is likely to be extended to London Euston, stating that terminating at Old Oak Common would not make sense. Previous work to expand Euston station was halted due to rising costs. An announcement regarding the final destination of HS2 is expected around the Budget on October 30. The current plan would require passengers to change trains at Old Oak Common, which Haigh criticized. The project has faced challenges, including cost overruns and community impact concerns. Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak suggested that private investment would be necessary to fund the extension to Euston, potentially saving taxpayers \u00a36.5bn. The Labour government\u2019s funding strategy for the extension remains unclear, and there are doubts about attracting sufficient private investment. Originally proposed in 2009, HS2 aims to connect London with major cities in the Midlands and North, with significant work already completed on the Birmingham to London section.",
