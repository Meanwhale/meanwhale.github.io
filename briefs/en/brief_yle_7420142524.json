    "news_text": "The Industry Union has deemed the proposed wage increases insufficient, resulting in planned strikes starting Monday. The employer side had accepted a proposal for a three-year contract with a total wage increase of 7%, but the union found this inadequate. The negotiations have been ongoing for five months, with no agreement reached despite multiple attempts. The situation is complicated by a new law affecting wage negotiations in export sectors, which has drawn criticism from unions in female-dominated industries. Mediation will continue on Wednesday.",
