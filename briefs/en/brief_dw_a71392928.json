    "news_text": "Italy's highest court confirmed the slander conviction of Amanda Knox, an American citizen, for implicating local bar owner Patrick Lumumba in the 2007 murder of her British roommate, Meredith Kercher. Knox's conviction stems from her accusations during police questioning, which led to Lumumba's wrongful imprisonment. Although Rudy Guede was later convicted of Kercher's murder, Knox's slander conviction remained. Knox expressed her disbelief at the verdict, while Lumumba welcomed the court's decision. Knox's legal battles have spanned nearly two decades, with her slander conviction being upheld despite previous acquittals in the murder case.",
