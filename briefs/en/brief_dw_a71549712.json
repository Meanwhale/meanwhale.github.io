    "news_text": "Ukraine&#x27;s presidential election has been delayed due to the war with Russia, now nearly three years since the invasion began. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has consistently stated that elections will be announced once martial law is lifted. Recent discussions about the election have intensified, particularly after US special envoy Keith Kellogg expressed a desire for Ukraine to hold elections, possibly by the end of the year, contingent on a truce with Moscow. The Ukrainian constitution prohibits elections during martial law, and Russia has used the absence of elections to question Zelenskyy&#x27;s legitimacy. Experts warn that holding elections too soon could jeopardize Ukraine&#x27;s democracy and security, emphasizing the need for stability and proper conditions before proceeding.",
