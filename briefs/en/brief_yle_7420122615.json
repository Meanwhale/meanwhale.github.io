    "news_text": "Elon Musk's organization was found guilty of fraud after it was revealed that a lottery advertised to voters was not conducted fairly. Musk has been charged with $1 million in relation to presidential elections. Registered voters were misled into signing a petition that falsely claimed winners would be randomly selected, when in fact they were pre-selected. A complaint filed in Austin, Texas, alleged that Musk and his America PAC encouraged this deception. The winners of the lottery were not awarded as promised, and the organization allegedly collected personal data from voters. A judge ruled that Musk's organization could continue sharing its prizes, despite challenges from authorities regarding the legality of the lottery.",
