    "news_text": "In Queensland, Australia, fourteen members of a Christian sect were convicted for the manslaughter of 8-year-old Elizabeth Struhs, who died from diabetic ketoacidosis after her parents denied her life-saving insulin on religious grounds. The sect believed in divine healing over medical treatment. The girl's parents were found guilty of neglecting their duty of care, while the sect's leader and other members were also convicted for encouraging this neglect. The court noted their grave moral guilt, but no murder charges were filed due to the inability to prove intent to kill. Sentencing is scheduled for February 11.",
