    "news_text": "The banker views the rapid decline of Euribor as a sign that interest rates may decrease more quickly than anticipated. The 12-month Euribor has dropped to 2.63%, its lowest since November 2022, reflecting a reduction of over half a percentage point this year. This decline translates to significant savings for mortgage holders; for instance, a 0.5% decrease on a EUR 100,000 mortgage could save around EUR 1,500 annually. Analysts suggest that the financial markets are pricing in a potential 0.5% rate cut from the ECB, although the central bank has indicated it may only lower rates by 0.25%. The recent drop in Euribor rates signals expectations of faster adjustments in monetary policy.",
