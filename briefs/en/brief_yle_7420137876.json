    "news_header": "California faces severe wildfires, prompting Airbnb to freeze rent prices. Authorities warn against price speculation as thousands evacuate and housing pressures increase.",
    "news_text": "Airbnb has been instructed to keep apartment rents unchanged amid California's wildfires, which have led to the evacuation of 31,000 people and the destruction of 10,000 properties. President Trump criticized the Biden administration's handling of the fires, highlighting issues with firefighting resources. The California Attorney General has urged the housing market to avoid exploiting disaster victims, as rent prices have surged despite laws against such speculation. The ban on rent increases is in effect until November, and Airbnb will comply by removing listings with excessive price hikes. Many residents are now homeless, and financial institutions are offering mortgage payment deferrals.",
