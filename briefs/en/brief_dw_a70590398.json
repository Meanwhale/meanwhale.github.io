    "news_header": "Georgia's upcoming elections are heavily influenced by the country's aspirations to join the EU, with the ruling party promoting a narrative of peace and stability amidst concerns over democratic backsliding and opposition suppression.",
    "news_text": "As Georgia approaches its elections, Tbilisi is adorned with blue, symbolizing the country's desire to join the EU, a goal enshrined in its constitution since 2018. Despite strong public support for EU accession, the ruling Georgian Dream party faces criticism for actions perceived as distancing the country from Europe. The party's slogan emphasizes EU membership 'with dignity,' suggesting a preference for negotiations on their own terms. Concerns over the government's threats to opposition parties and independent media have raised alarms about the state of democracy in Georgia. The election is seen as pivotal, with many voters hoping for a shift towards pro-EU parties. However, the ruling party's controversial campaign tactics, including linking the Ukraine war to LGBTQ+ rights and promoting traditional family values, have sparked debate. Polls indicate uncertainty about the ruling party's support, with many citizens expressing a desire for better living conditions and a clear path towards EU integration.",
