    "news_text": "Researchers have identified a new fungus named Gibellula attenboroughii, which infects cave spiders and alters their behavior, forcing them to move to exposed areas. This fungus, first observed in Northern Ireland, consumes the spider&#x27;s internal organs and leads to the emergence of spore-producing structures. The study highlights the unique ecological role of this fungus and its potential implications for pest control and medical innovations.",
