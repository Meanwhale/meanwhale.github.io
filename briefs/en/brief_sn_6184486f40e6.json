    "news_text": "Gibellula attenboroughii, a newly identified fungus named after Sir David Attenborough, infects cave spiders, causing them to behave like zombies by moving to exposed areas. This behavior likely aids in the dispersal of the fungus&#x27;s spores. The fungus was first observed on a spider during a BBC documentary in Northern Ireland. Researchers have found that the fungus consumes the spider&#x27;s internal organs and changes its behavior, similar to the effects seen in fungus-infected ants. The study of this fungus could have implications for pest control and medical innovations in the future.",
