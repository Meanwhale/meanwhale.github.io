    "news_text": "Bhavreen Kandhari, a Delhi resident and co-founder of Warrior Moms, highlights the persistent health issues faced by her twin daughters due to poor air quality in the city, which worsens during Diwali. The Indian capital struggles with hazardous air pollution, prompting the use of air purifiers and masks. The Supreme Court criticized the central government for inadequate action against pollution, while political blame games continue between the ruling BJP and the opposition AAP. Experts advocate for addressing pollution at its source rather than relying on temporary solutions like smog towers. Recent reports indicate a significant rise in respiratory illnesses, particularly among vulnerable populations. The Air Quality Life Index suggests that pollution in Delhi could reduce life expectancy by up to 7.8 years, necessitating comprehensive policy changes to combat the crisis.",
