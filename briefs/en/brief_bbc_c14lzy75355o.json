    "news_text": "Mozambique's ruling party, Frelimo, has secured victory in a contentious election, maintaining its 49-year rule. Daniel Chapo, the new presidential candidate, received 71% of the vote, succeeding Filipe Nyusi. Following the announcement, violent protests erupted, resulting in fatalities and a heavy police presence. Allegations of election rigging and the killing of opposition supporters have marred the election process. The opposition, led by Venancio Mondlane, who garnered 20%, has called for a national strike and protests against the results. The electoral commission reported a 43% voter turnout, with Frelimo also winning the majority of parliamentary and provincial seats. Critics, including EU observers, have raised concerns about electoral integrity, while Chapo is set to be sworn in January.",
