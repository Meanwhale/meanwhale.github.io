    "news_text": "Kenya's Senate has begun discussions on the impeachment of Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua after a Nairobi court deemed the proceedings constitutional. The National Assembly previously voted overwhelmingly to impeach him on 11 charges, including corruption and threatening a judge. Gachagua, who denies the allegations, intends to remain in office until the Senate's decision. If impeached, he would be the first leader removed since the constitutional provision was established in 2010. Gachagua, a powerful businessman, has faced previous scandals but was elected as President Ruto's running mate in 2022. He has expressed feelings of being sidelined and discarded within the administration amid recent youth-led protests against tax hikes.",
