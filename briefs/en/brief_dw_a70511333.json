    "news_text": "The Kenyan Senate has started discussions on the impeachment of Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua after a Nairobi court deemed the proceedings constitutional. The National Assembly had previously voted overwhelmingly to impeach him on 11 charges related to corruption and abuse of office, including threats against a judge. Gachagua, who denies the allegations, intends to remain in his position until the Senate makes a decision. If impeached, he would be the first leader in Kenya to face such action since the constitutional process was established in 2010. Gachagua, a powerful businessman, has faced previous scandals but was elected as President William Ruto's running mate in 2022. He has expressed concerns about being marginalized within the administration and has been linked to youth-led protests against tax hikes.",
