    "news_text": "UPM has announced the start of change negotiations within its UPM Fibres organization, impacting approximately 1,600 employees in Finland's pulp and timber sectors. The negotiations may result in the reduction of around 110 positions and include potential layoffs lasting up to 90 days in early 2025. UPM cites the need to ensure profitability as the reason for these negotiations, which will begin on October 16 and last at least six weeks. Concerns have been raised by union representatives regarding the impact on workers, especially following previous job cuts. The negotiations will involve discussions with employee groups to determine the outcomes, including how layoffs might be distributed across different locations. The decline in profitability is attributed to rising raw material costs and the cessation of timber imports from Russia due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.",
