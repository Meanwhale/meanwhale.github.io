    "news_text": "On Tuesday, Kenyan lawmakers impeached Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, accusing him of corruption, inciting ethnic division, and supporting anti-government protests. The impeachment motion passed with 281 votes in favor, surpassing the required two-thirds majority, and will now go to the upper house for final approval. If successful, Gachagua would be the first deputy president removed under Kenya's revised constitution. Gachagua has denied the charges, claiming they are politically motivated and linked to tensions with President William Ruto. He warned that his removal could lead to discontent among his supporters, who played a crucial role in Ruto's election victory in 2022.",
