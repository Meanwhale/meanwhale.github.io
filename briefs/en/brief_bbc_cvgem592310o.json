    "news_text": "Next's CEO, Lord Wolfson, expressed concerns that recent tax changes in the Budget, including increased National Insurance and a lowered threshold for payments, will negatively impact entry-level jobs and make it harder for people to enter the workforce. He urged the government to stagger these changes over time to avoid job cuts. Despite the Treasury's claim that most employers will see no change or a cut in National Insurance bills, Wolfson warned that the retail sector, especially those employing lower-paid workers, would feel the brunt of these changes. He highlighted a significant rise in Next's wage bill and the potential reduction in employee hours. The overall economic impact is concerning, with rising costs leading to decreased confidence among businesses.",
