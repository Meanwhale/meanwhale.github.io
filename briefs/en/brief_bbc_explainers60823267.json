    "news_text": "Leaders from nearly every country are meeting in Colombia for COP16, a UN biodiversity summit, to assess progress in protecting the natural world as one million species face extinction, including over 20 hummingbirds. The summit follows a historic agreement made in December 2022 to protect 30% of Earth's land and seas by 2030. Biodiversity, which encompasses all life forms, is crucial for human survival, providing essential resources like clean air and food. However, human activities have accelerated species extinction rates significantly, leading to warnings of a potential sixth mass extinction. The summit aims to hold countries accountable for their conservation commitments and address issues like financial support for biodiversity projects, especially in poorer nations. The Colombian environment minister has set the theme 'Peace with Nature' to encourage a reevaluation of humanity's relationship with the environment.",
