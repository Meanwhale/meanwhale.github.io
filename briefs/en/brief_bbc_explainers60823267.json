    "news_text": "Leaders from nearly every country are gathering in Colombia for COP16, a UN biodiversity summit, to evaluate progress in protecting nature amid alarming extinction rates. The summit follows a 2022 agreement to reverse biodiversity loss by 2030, with goals for ecosystem conservation, sustainable resource use, and equitable sharing of natural resources. Currently, over one million species, including 40% of amphibians, are at risk of extinction due to human activities. The meeting aims to hold countries accountable for their commitments, as many are falling short on national action plans. The Colombian environment minister emphasizes the theme 'Peace with Nature' to encourage a reevaluation of humanity's relationship with the environment.",
