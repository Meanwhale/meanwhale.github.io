    "news_text": "Pope Francis is in critical condition following a respiratory crisis that required high flows of supplemental oxygen and blood transfusions. The Vatican reported that he is conscious but fragile, undergoing further clinical tests. Doctors have warned of the risk of sepsis, a serious complication of pneumonia. Despite his health issues, Francis had prepared a message expressing confidence in his treatment and acknowledging the painful anniversary of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine. His recent decisions indicate awareness of his frailty, including revising funeral rites and extending terms for key cardinals. The situation has raised speculation about his potential resignation if his condition worsens.",
