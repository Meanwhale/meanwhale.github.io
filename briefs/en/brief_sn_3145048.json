    "news_text": "Recent observations of male Victoria's riflebird courtship behaviors reveal their ability to hyperextend their wings and produce percussion sounds by striking their feathers with their beaks. This phenomenon, previously misunderstood, showcases the remarkable flexibility of their wrist bones, allowing them to create a curved arc of feathers while courting. Researchers concluded that the sound is generated by the beak drumming against the fanned feathers, akin to playing an instrument. The study highlights the extreme wrist flexibility of these birds, which is unmatched in the avian world.",
