    "news_text": "In Finland, new car registrations dropped by 15.4% in 2024, totaling 74,072 compared to 87,509 in 2023. This decline is attributed to various factors, including high interest rates and economic uncertainty, particularly in regions like Southern Savo, where sales fell by 22.5%. Despite the downturn in new car sales, the market for used cars grew by 4.3%, with increased imports of low-driven electric and hybrid vehicles, mainly from Sweden. The average age of passenger cars in Finland has risen to 13.6 years, with older fleets in Kainuu and North Karelia. This trend of an ageing car stock raises concerns about repair needs and safety, as Finland&#x27;s vehicles are older than those in many other Nordic countries and the EU average of 12.3 years.",
