    "news_text": "In the recent parliamentary election in Lithuania, the Social Democrats emerged victorious, securing 52 out of 141 seats with 99% of the votes counted. The ruling conservative Homeland Union Party is projected to come in second with 28 seats. Social Democrat leader Vilija Blinkeviciute expressed confidence in forming a majority coalition with two other parties. The election was influenced by issues such as the war in Ukraine, high inflation, and dissatisfaction with the current government's handling of various crises. Analysts are uncertain about the future stability of the ruling coalition, while the Social Democrats plan to maintain a strong defense posture against Russia and address social inequality through tax reforms. The election reflects a desire for change among the Lithuanian populace, with national security concerns also playing a significant role in voters' decisions.",
