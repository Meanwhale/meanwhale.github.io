    "news_text": "A recent survey in Finland reveals a declining willingness among both men and women to continue working in their current roles, with only 11% expressing a desire to work full-time. The trend shows that older individuals are more inclined to stop working altogether, while younger people are more open to continuing in their current jobs. Many respondents indicated they would prefer part-time work or alternative pursuits like volunteering or studying if financial concerns were not a factor. The survey also highlights a shift in values, with younger generations prioritizing the content of work over pay.",
