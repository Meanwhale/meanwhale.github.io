    "news_text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has increased its growth forecast for the UK economy to 1.1% for this year, up from 0.7% previously. Chancellor Rachel Reeves welcomed the forecast but acknowledged more work is needed, highlighting the challenging economic circumstances inherited from 14 years of Conservative rule. The IMF's outlook suggests that while the UK economy is growing slowly, it is positioned in the middle among global nations. The IMF supports increased public investment to boost growth, particularly in productivity-enhancing areas. Meanwhile, the US economy is projected to grow by 2.8% this year, outperforming other advanced economies, while emerging economies face persistent inflation issues. The Russian economy's growth forecast has also been upgraded due to its war economy, although a significant slowdown is expected next year.",
