    "news_text": "In June, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to discuss a security partnership amid rumors of North Korean arms deliveries to Russia. South Korean intelligence reports indicate that North Korea may provide up to 12,000 soldiers to Russia for its war in Ukraine, with around 3,000 already reported to be in Russia. The soldiers are expected to wear Russian uniforms to conceal their identity. While there is speculation about the extent of North Korean involvement, experts caution against assuming a large number of troops are actively fighting in Ukraine. This development has raised concerns in Ukraine and among European nations, especially with the upcoming US elections potentially impacting support for Ukraine. NATO has noted that North Korean troop involvement would signify a significant escalation in support for Russia. European leaders are urged to respond decisively to this situation, as North Korea seeks financial and technological benefits from its cooperation with Russia.",
