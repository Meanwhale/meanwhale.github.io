    "news_text": "The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is experiencing a significant rise in support, potentially becoming the second largest political force in Germany after the upcoming elections. Critics label the AfD as radical and anti-democratic, while supporters align it with populist movements across Europe, sharing similar stances on migration and foreign policy. Germany&#x27;s economic struggles and a growing discontent with traditional parties have contributed to the AfD&#x27;s appeal. The party&#x27;s hard-right positions have sparked debates about national identity and immigration, especially following incidents involving asylum seekers. Despite its rising popularity, the AfD faces challenges in gaining actual governance power due to Germany&#x27;s coalition-based political system, which aims to prevent any single party from dominating, particularly a far-right one. The political landscape in Germany is shifting, with mainstream parties adjusting their rhetoric in response to the AfD&#x27;s influence, indicating a significant change in the country&#x27;s political dynamics.",
