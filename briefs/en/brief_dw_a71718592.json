    "news_original_title": "China accuses Australia of &#x27;hyping&#x27; live-fire navy drills",
    "news_text": "China has dismissed Australia&#x27;s accusations regarding insufficient notice before its naval drills in international waters, labeling them as unreasonable and exaggerated. The drills, which occurred between Australia and New Zealand, led to the diversion of three flights, prompting complaints from both nations. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles noted that while China did not breach international law, it failed to adhere to best practices by not providing 12-24 hours&#x27; notice. Wu Qian, a spokesperson for China&#x27;s Defense Ministry, stated that China did issue prior safety notices and that the Australian claims were inconsistent with the facts. He emphasized that there was no impact on air safety and expressed surprise and dissatisfaction with Australia&#x27;s response.",
