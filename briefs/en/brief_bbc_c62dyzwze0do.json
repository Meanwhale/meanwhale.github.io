    "news_text": "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's agreement to send migrants rescued at sea to processing camps in Albania has been challenged by a special immigration court in Rome. The court ruled that 12 migrants from unsafe countries should be returned to Italy, undermining the deal just days after its implementation. Meloni plans to appeal the ruling, asserting that it is the government's role to determine the safety of countries. The agreement aims to process and repatriate around 3,000 irregular migrants monthly, but has faced criticism for its high cost and exclusion of women and children. Meanwhile, EU leaders are under pressure to expedite the return of irregular migrants, and other countries, like the Netherlands, are exploring similar plans without prior discussions with the involved nations.",
