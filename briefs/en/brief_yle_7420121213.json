    "news_text": "The National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) has introduced a new drinking strategy in Finland, noting that alcohol consumption has decreased significantly, now below the European average. While Finland has adopted a more civilized drinking style, THL warns against the risks associated with European drinking habits, which are often linked to health issues. Since 2007, alcohol consumption has dropped by over 25%, leading to fewer alcohol-related harms. Despite this positive trend, a significant portion of the population still engages in risky drinking behaviors, particularly among younger adults. The report emphasizes the need to maintain low consumption levels to ensure public health and wellbeing.",
