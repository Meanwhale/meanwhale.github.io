    "news_text": "Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD reported quarterly revenues exceeding 200 billion yuan ($28.2 billion), marking a 24% increase from the previous year and surpassing Tesla's revenue of $25.2 billion for the first time. While BYD's sales are rising, Tesla remains the leader in EV sales. The growth in BYD's revenue is attributed to government subsidies in China aimed at promoting electric and hybrid vehicles. However, the company faces challenges abroad, including new EU tariffs of up to 45.3% on Chinese EV imports, which are a response to concerns over unfair state support for the industry. Despite these challenges, BYD achieved a monthly sales record, indicating strong momentum in the domestic market. The Chinese government is relying on high-tech products to stimulate its economy, with the EU being a significant market for its electric vehicles.",
