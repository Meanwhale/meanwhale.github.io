    "news_header": "Portugal has ended the practice of allowing illegal migrant workers to stay while applying for work permits, citing alignment with European regulations, which has raised concerns among NGOs about the impact on immigration policy and labor needs.",
    "news_text": "Portugal has abruptly ceased the practice of permitting illegally arrived migrant workers to remain in the country while applying for work permits, a move described by Deputy Minister Rui Armindo Freitas as necessary to align with European regulations. This decision has drawn criticism from NGOs, who view it as a concession to right-wing populists and indicative of a disorganized immigration policy. The government aims to address a backlog of 400,000 legalization applications, but the new requirement for migrants to apply for residence permits from abroad has caused frustration, particularly for workers from countries without Portuguese embassies. The agricultural sector, heavily reliant on migrant labor, faces challenges as the new rules could exacerbate the number of undocumented workers. Freitas argues that the changes are intended to clarify immigration rules and protect migrants from exploitation, while NGOs warn that this could lead to an increase in illegal immigration.",
